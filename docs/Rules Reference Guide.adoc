== Rules Reference

This document is intended as the definitive source for rules information for the Emerald Legacy, the fan continuation of Fantasy Flight Games' Legend of the 5 Rings LCG.
The majority of this guide consists of the glossary, which provides an alphabetical listing of terms and situations a player might encounter during a game.
This section should be the first destination for players who have a rules question.
The latter part of this guide contains two appendices.
The first appendix provides detailed timing diagrams that illustrate the structure of an entire game round, as well as how to handle each game step presented in those diagrams.
The second provides a detailed anatomy of each card type.

== The Emerald Rule

If the text of this Rules Reference directly contradicts the text of FFG's Rules Reference, the Emerald Legacy Rules Reference takes precedence. Changes to FFG's Rules Reference are shown in *bold*. Changes to the last version of the Emerald Legacy RRG are written in [.font-color: green]#green#.

If the text of a card directly contradicts the text of this Rules Reference, the text of the card takes precedence.

== Glossary
The following is an alphabetical list of entries for game rules, terms, and situations that may occur during play.

=== Ability
An ability is the special game text that a card contributes to the game. Card abilities fall into one of the following types: actions, constant abilities, interrupts, keywords, and reactions. Some interrupt and reaction abilities are also forced.

- Card abilities only interact with, and can only target, cards that are in play, unless the ability specifically refers to an out-of-play area or element. Card abilities on characters, attachments, holdings, strongholds, and provinces can only be initiated or affect the game while they are in play unless the ability specifically refers to being used from an out-of-play area, or require that the card be out of play for the ability to resolve. Event cards and role cards implicitly interact with the game from an out-of-play area, as established by the rules of their card types.
- The application or initiation of the following types of abilities is mandatory: constant abilities, forced interrupt abilities, and forced reaction abilities.
- The initiation of any keyword which uses the word "may" in its keyword description is optional. The application of all other keywords is mandatory.
- The initiation of action, interrupt, and reaction abilities is optional. The word "may" also incorporates a player option into the resolution of an ability. The player who controls the card on which an optional ability exists determines whether or not he or she wishes to use that ability at the appropriate time.
- An ability prefaced by a bold-face timing trigger followed by a colon is referred to as a "triggered ability."
- The controller of the card from which an ability is resolving makes all decisions required by that ability's resolution unless another player is specified by the ability's text.

*Related:* Cost, Effects, Forced, Target, Triggered Abilities

=== Action, Action Ability
An action ability is a triggered card ability that contains the boldface "Action:" precursor. An action ability may be triggered by its controller during any action window (see "Appendix I: Timing and Gameplay").

- Unless otherwise noted by the ability, each action ability may be initiated only once each round. 
- An action that has been initiated must be resolved before the next action can be initiated.

*Related:* Ability, Triggered Abilities

=== Active Player
In some phases, the game creates an active player, who is granted
permission to perform a specified task.

- During the dynasty phase, the active player is the player who is permitted to play character cards from his or her provinces or initiate an action ability. The status of active player alternates between players in this phase until all players have passed.

- During the conflict phase, the active player is the player with the opportunity to initiate a conflict, or the player who is resolving a conflict he or she has initiated.

=== Additional Conflicts
Some card abilities allow a player to declare an additional conflict during the conflict phase. The additional conflict created by such an effect is in addition to a player's two normal conflict opportunities. It does not replace the normal [military] or [political] conflict opportunity that player has each conflict phase.

=== Additional Cost
Some card abilities require an additional cost to be played to play a card, trigger an ability, or perform a framework step. If the additional cost cannot be paid, the game action cannot be initiated.

- All costs are paid simultaneously, including additional ones.
*Related:* Cost

=== Against
During a conflict, the attacking player and the defending player are considered to be taking part in the conflict against each other.

=== Ancestral
Ancestral is a keyword ability that appears on attachments. If the card or game element to which an ancestral attachment is attached leaves play, the ancestral attachment is returned to its owner's hand instead of being discarded.

=== Attachment Cards
Attachment cards represent weapons, armor, items, skills, spells, conditions, and titles. An attachment card enters play ready and attached to another card or game element, and remains in play unless it is removed by an ability, or unless the attached card leaves
play.

- An attachment cannot enter play if there is no eligible card or game element to which it can attach. *A card or game element becomes ineligible for a player's attachment if a copy of that attachment controlled by the same player is already attached to it.*

*Example:* _Otomo Courtier is the only character in play and has Karolina's Ornate Fan attached to it. Karolina has another copy of Ornate Fan in hand, but she is not allowed to play it, as there are no eligible targets for it. She cannot choose to play Ornate Fan on the Otomo Courtier and discard the other copy. Karolina's opponent Martin, however, can play his copy of Ornate Fan on the Otomo Courtier, as the two copies of Ornate Fan would be controlled by different players._

- An attachment can only attach to a character in play, unless otherwise specified by the attachment's text.

- There is no limit on the number of attachments that may be attached to a card or game element. *However, only one copy of an attachment (by name) per player can be attached to a card or game element at the same time.*

- *If a situation arises where a card or game element has multiple copies of an attachment controlled by the same player attached to it, its controller (or the First Player, if there is no controller) must immediately discard copies of that attachment until there is only one copy attached.*

- If the card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, simultaneously discard the attachment.

- If a situation arises in which an attachment is not legally attached, discard the attachment.

- An attachment a player controls remains under his or her control even if the card or game element to which it is attached is under an opponent's control.

- An attachment card bows and readies independently of the card to which it is attached.

- If an attachment has skill modifiers, those modifiers apply to the skill of the attached character. Such modifiers apply to the character even while the attachment is bowed.

- Attachments on a province are not considered to be in that province.

- If a character card is in play as an attachment, the skill values on that character-as-attachment are not treated as skill modifiers (as they lack the "+" or "-" symbol before the value) for the character to which the card is attached.

- If an attachment has a limit (for example "Limit 1 *_Battlefield_* attachment per province"), that indicates that only one instance of a particular subset of cards can be attached to the same card or game element. If a second card of that subset becomes attached to the card or game element, the previously attached card is discarded as the limit has been surpassed.

For attachment card anatomy, see "[link Appendix II: Card Anatomy]".

=== Attacker, Attacking Character, Attacking Player
The term "attacking character" refers to a character that is participating in a conflict on the side of the player who initiated the conflict. The term "attacker" is also used as shorthand for "attacking character."

The term "attacking player" refers to the player that initiated the conflict that is currently resolving.

=== Base Value
The value of a quantity before other modifiers are applied. For most quantities, it is also the printed value.

=== Bid Value
If the value of an honor bid is modified, resolve that bid as if the modified value is that player's bid. The value of a bid may exceed five (the highest number on the honor dial), or may be reduced to zero.

- When the value of an honor bid is modified, the setting on the dial is not itself adjusted.

- If a card ability references a player's honor bid, the ability is referencing the current setting on the player's honor dial.

=== Blank
If an ability causes a card's printed text box to be considered "blank," that text box is treated as if it did not have any of its printed *_Traits_* or card abilities. Text gained from another source is not blanked.

=== Breaking a Province, Broken Province
If the attacking player wins a conflict with a total skill difference (between the attacking player and the defending player) equal to or greater than the defense strength of the attacked province, the province breaks.

- Rotate a province card 180 degrees or discard a province token to indicate the province is broken.

- When a province is broken, the attacking player has the option of discarding any dynasty cards in that province. If this option is taken, the province is refilled facedown.

- Ability text on a broken province card is not active.

- Dynasty cards may still be played from broken provinces, and broken provinces still refill following the standard game rules.

- If three of a player's non-stronghold provinces are broken, that player's stronghold becomes an eligible province against which attacks may be made. If a player's stronghold province is broken, that player loses the game.
** If a player does not have a stronghold province, they lose the game when all of their provinces are broken.

- If a province breaks for any reason other than through standard conflict resolution, the opponent of the player who controls that province is considered to have broken the province.
** If a player has multiple opponents, each of those players is
considered to have broken the province.

=== Bow, Bowed
Cards often bow after participating in a conflict, to use card abilities, or as the result of card or game effects. When a card is bowed, it is rotated 90 degrees. A card in this latter state is considered bowed.

- A bowed card cannot bow again until it is ready. Cards are typically readied by a game step or card ability.

- During conflicts, bowed characters do not contribute their skill.

- A bowed attachment with skill modifiers still modifies the skill of the attached character.

- A card ability on a bowed card is active and can still engage with the game state. However, if a bowed card must bow as part of its cost to trigger an ability, it cannot bow again until it is readied, so the ability could not be triggered.

=== Cancel
Some card abilities can "cancel" other card or game effects. Cancel abilities interrupt the initiation of an effect, and prevent the effect from initiating. Because of this, cancel abilities have timing priority over *_all_* other interrupts to the effect that is attempting to initiate.

- If an effect is canceled, that effect is no longer imminent, and further interrupts (including cancels) cannot be initiated in reference to the canceled effect.

- If the effects of an ability are canceled, the ability is still considered to have been used, and any costs have still been paid.

- If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and it is still placed in its owner's discard pile.

- If a ring effect that is resolving for winning a conflict is  canceled, the ring is still claimed.

=== Cannot
The word "cannot" is absolute, and cannot be countermanded by
other abilities or effects.

=== Cards under another card
Some card effects like Kaiu Shihobu (Defenders of Rokugan 10), Togashi Tsurumi (Through the Mists 13) or Stowaway (Through the Mists 50) place cards under another card. These cards are out of play and can only be interacted with by effects that explicitly state that.

- If a card leaves play, any cards that have been put under it this way are removed from the game, unless otherwise specified by the effect that put them there.

- This does not apply to attachments, only to cards that are explicitly placed under/underneath a card by a card effect.

=== Cardtypes
The game's card types are: character, attachment, holding, event, province, stronghold, and role. Each of these card types, with a detailed card anatomy, is presented in "Appendix II: Card Anatomy".

- If an ability causes a card to change its card type, the card loses all other card types it might possess, and functions as would any card of the new card type.

=== Challenge
Some card abilities use the word "challenge" to begin the process of resolving a duel between two characters. For the rules on how to resolve a duel, see "Duel timing".

=== Character Cards
Character cards represent the bushi, courtiers, shugenja, monks, shinobi, armies, creatures, and other personalities and groups one might encounter in Rokugan.

-Characters played from a player's provinces can only be played during the dynasty phase. Characters played from a player's hand can only be played during any action window outside of the dynasty phase.

- Character cards generally enter play ready and in a player's home area, and remain in play unless removed by an ability or game step.

- When a player plays a character from his or her hand during a conflict, the player has the option to play it directly into the conflict, ready and participating on his or her side.

- When a player plays a character in a team conquest format game, that player chooses to either play it under their own control or under the control of a teammate. Once played, control cannot be exchanged except by card effects. Fate is placed on the character from the fate pool of the player playing the character, regardless of which player controls it.

For character card anatomy, see "Appendix II: Card Anatomy".

=== Choose
The word "choose" indicates that one or more targets must be chosen in order to resolve an ability.

*Related*: Target

=== Clan
There are 7 clans in the core set, as depicted in the chart below.

A player's stronghold card signals which clan a player has chosen as the primary clan for his or her deck. The clans and their associated symbols are listed below.

- An "in-clan" card bears a clan symbol that matches the clan symbol on its controller's stronghold card.

- An "out-of-clan" card bears one or more clan symbols that do not match the clan symbol on its controller's stronghold card, and does not bear a clan symbol that matches the clan symbol on its controller's stronghold card.
** If a player does not have a stronghold card, "in-clan" and "out-of-clan" determination is defined by the clan selected during deckbuilding to be that player's primary clan.

[-WORKING ENTRY POINT-] +
Composure
Composure is a variable keyword ability. A card with this keyword
gains an additional ability while its controller's honor bid is lower
than that of one of his or her opponents.
Most uses of the composure keyword grant a constant ability
that modifies a character's skills or glory. Some may grant
triggered abilities that can only be used while a player has
composure.
"You have composure" is the phrase indicating that a player's
composure keyword is active. It is used in reminder text to
indicate that a player's card has the ability granted by
composure while their honor bid is lower than an opponent's.
Conflict
During the conflict phase, each player has two opportunities to
declare a conflict against an opponent. For the rules on how to
resolve conflicts, see Framework Details.
Conflict (Conflict Action, Conflict Reaction,
Conflict Interrupt), Triggered Conflict Ability
If a triggered ability is preceded by the modifier "Conflict", that
ability can only be triggered during a conflict. It functions as a
shorthand for the following triggering conditions:
On events, provinces, strongholds and holdings "Conflict X:"
replaces "X: During a conflict, ..."
On characters "Conflict X:" replaces "X: During a conflict in
which this character is participating, ..."
On attachments "Conflict X:" replaces "X: During a conflict in
which attached character is participating, ..."
If a Triggered Conflict Ability can only be triggered in a conflict
of a specific type, the boldface timing command is preceded by
the or symbols, respectively.

Example: A character has the ability " Conflict Action: Pay 1
fate - ready this character." This is equivalent to "Action: During
a conflict in which this character is participating, pay 1 fate
- ready this character."
If a card's remaining triggering conditions directly contradict
parts of this replacement, the card's text takes precedence.
Example: The attachment Stinger (Through the Mists 34) has
the ability " Conflict Action: While this card is in your hand,
choose an attacking character and lose 1 honor - ...". Because
Stinger has to be in your hand in order to trigger its ability, it
does not have an attached character. In this case, the "
Conflict Action:" is interpreted as "Action: During a conflict,
..." instead of "Action: During a conflict in which attached
character is participating, ..."
If a player is instructed to resolve a Triggered Conflict Ability on
a character, the triggering conditions above must still be met.
This means that the character must be participating in a
conflict of the right type (if specified).
Conflicts at Multiple Provinces
When a conflict is at multiple provinces, each of those provinces is
the "attacked province" and abilities that interact with the conflict
being at those provinces can be used.
During the resolution of a conflict at multiple provinces, compare
the attacking player's excess skill against the strength of each
attacked province separately to determine if that province is
broken.
Any card ability that interacts with "the attacked province"
interacts with one (not both) of those provinces.
Constant Abilities
A constant ability is any non-keyword ability whose text contains
no boldface timing trigger defining its ability type. A constant
ability becomes active as soon as its card enters play and remains
active while the card is in play.
Some constant abilities continuously seek a specific condition
(denoted by words such as "during," "if," or "while"). The
effects of such abilities are active any time the specified
condition is met.
If multiple instances of the same constant ability are in play,
each instance affects the game state independently.
If a constant ability would cause a card to leave play, interrupt
abilities cannot be used to replace or prevent that constant
ability.
Control and Ownership
A card's owner is the player who included the card as a part of his
or her deck (i.e., dynasty deck, conflict deck, provinces, stronghold,
role) at the beginning of the game.
By default, cards enter play under their owner's control. Some
abilities may cause cards to change control during a game.
A player controls the cards in his or her out-of-play game areas
(such as the hand, the dynasty and conflict decks, and the
dynasty and conflict discard piles).
If a card would enter an out-of-play area of a player who does
not own the card, the card is placed in its owner's equivalent
out-of-play area instead. (For all associated card ability and

8
framework effect purposes, the card is considered to have
entered that opponent's out-of-play area, and only the physical
placement of the card is adjusted.)
If a participating character changes control during a conflict, it
is considered participating in the same conflict on the side of
its new controller.
When a character changes control while it is in play, it remains
in the same state as it was before (i.e., bowed or ready,
participating or at home, etc.), and is now under the new
player's control.
Attachments on a card that changes control do not themselves
change control.
Unless a duration is specified, a control change persists as long
as the card remains in play.
Copy (of a card)
A copy of a card is defined by title: any other card that shares the
same title is considered a copy, regardless of card type, text, deck
of origin, artwork, or any other characteristic(s) of the card(s).
A card is considered to be a copy of itself, as it shares its own
title.
Copy (of a character)
Some card abilities may cause a character to become a copy of
another character. When that happens, the character that is
changing loses its name, cost, base skills and glory, traits, clan
affiliation, and ability text. It gains the name, cost, base skills and
glory, traits, clan affiliation, and ability text of the copied character
for the duration indicated by the card ability.
Cards that refer to a character's printed text (skills, traits,
abilities, etc.) still refer to the text physically printed on the
card.
When a character becomes a copy of another character, only
the base skills and printed characteristics are copied. If the
character that is changing gains characteristics (such as traits
or ability text) from another non-copy card ability (such as an
event or attachment) then those characteristics are not lost.
A character can only become a copy of a unique character if its
owner and/or controller does not also own or control a copy
(by title) of that unique character.
Becoming a copy of another character replaces the character's
base skills and glory. This is not applying a modifier (dashes can
be replaced).
A character cannot become a copy of another character if both
characters have the same title.
Corrupted
Corrupted is a keyword ability. A character with the corrupted
keyword enters play tainted. Abilities cannot be triggered from a
corrupted character receiving the tainted status token from this
keyword, as that card enters play already with that status.
Related: Tainted, Tainted Status Token, Status Token

Cost
A card's cost is the numerical value that dictates how much fate
must be paid to play the card from a player's hand or provinces.
Some triggered card abilities also have an ability cost. Any
imperative instruction (other than "choose...," which denotes one
or more targets must be chosen, or "select...," which denotes that
one or more of a number of effects must be selected) that appears
before the dash of a triggered ability is considered a part of that
ability's cost. Some examples of ability cost instructions are:
"Bow...," "Spend...," "Sacrifice...," "Lose...," "Dishonor...," and
"Discard...."
Unless otherwise specified, a card effect that modifies a cost
only modifies the fate cost.
If a card has a dash as its printed fate cost, the card cannot be
played. Its printed fate cost is considered to be 0 for the
purposes of card abilities which require a numerical value.
When a player is paying a cost, the payment must be made with
cards and/or game elements that player controls. The word
"friendly" is used as a reminder of this in some costs.
If a cost requires a game element that is not in play, the player
paying the cost may only use game elements that are in his or
her out-of-play areas or token pools to pay the cost.
If multiple costs for a single card or ability require payment,
those costs must be paid simultaneously.
If any part of a cost payment is prevented, once all costs that
can be paid are paid, the process of initiating the ability or
playing the card immediately ends without further resolution.
(If this occurs while playing a card, the card remains unplayed
in its owner's hand or province.)
An ability cannot initiate (and therefore its costs cannot be
paid) if its effect on its own does not have the potential to
change the game state.
Related: Additional Cost
Count
When instructed to count a total of game values on a subset of
characters, values on bowed characters are not counted.
Courtesy
Courtesy is a keyword ability. When a card with the courtesy
keyword leaves play, its controller gains 1 fate.
The courtesy keyword resolves after the card leaves play,
before reactions to that card leaving play can be triggered.
Covert
Covert is a keyword ability. When a player initiates a conflict, if at
least one character with the covert keyword is declared as an
attacker, that player may choose one character without covert
controlled by the defending player. That character is considered
evaded by covert, and cannot be declared as a defender for that
conflict.
If multiple characters with the covert keyword are declared
as attackers, the evaded character is considered to be chosen
and evaded by each of those characters' covert abilities.

9
When a conflict is initiated against a facedown province,
resolve the covert keyword before revealing that province.
Card abilities may be used to move characters that have been
evaded by covert into a conflict as defenders.
Covert may only be used when characters are declared as
attackers. If a character with covert is moved into or played
into a conflict after the point at which the conflict was
declared, that character's covert ability does not resolve.
Current
If an ability references a "current" skill or glory count, use the
players' applicable specified totals at the time the ability resolves.
When resolving an ability that references a "current" skill or
glory count during a conflict, count the skill or glory values that
would be used if the conflict were currently resolving.
Dash (-)
In the text of a triggered ability, a dash (-) is used to separate the
criteria that are necessary to use the ability from the effect of the
ability. Any triggering conditions, play restrictions or permissions,
costs, and targeting requirements are denoted before the dash.
The ability's effect is denoted after the dash.
If a character has a dash (-) for a skill value, that character cannot
participate in, be played into, or be put into play in conflicts of that
type.
Should a character with a dash skill value somehow end up
participating in a conflict of the corresponding type, that
character is immediately removed from the conflict, and
placed in its controller's home area in a bowed state.
If a character has a dash for a skill value, that skill value cannot
be modified by card abilities.
If a character has a dash for a skill value and a card ability
requires a numerical value for that skill, treat the card as if it
had an unmodifiable skill value of 0.
A character with a dash skill value cannot be involved in a duel
of that skill type.

Deckbuilding
To build custom decks for Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game:
A player must choose exactly 1 stronghold.
A player may use 1 role card.
A player's dynasty deck must contain a minimum of 40 and a
maximum of 45 cards. Each of these cards must be in-clan or
be neutral.
A player's conflict deck must contain a minimum of 40 and a
maximum of 45 cards. Each of these cards must be in-clan, be
neutral, or be purchased from a single other clan by using
influence.
A player's stronghold indicates the amount of influence
that player may spend during deckbuilding.
No more than 3 copies of a single card by title can be included
in any combination in a player's dynasty and conflict decks.

A player cannot include more than 1 card (by card title) from
the Restricted List in their decks and set of provinces. Up to a
full legal playset (usually 3 copies) of that card may be included
in the appropriate deck or provinces.
A player's set of provinces must include exactly 5 provinces. For
each element, that player must choose one province
associated with that element, such that all five elements are
represented among their set of provinces. (Each province has
a ring symbol in the lower right corner of the card to indicate
its association.) Each of these provinces must be in-clan or be
neutral.
No more than 1 copy of each province, by title, may be
included in a player's set of provinces.
Any additional deckbuilding restrictions contained in the
separate Imperial Law document, based on the format being
played, must be followed.
The skirmish format follows different deckbuilding rules than
each other format. When building decks for the skirmish
format, use the following rules instead:
Do not include stronghold, role, or province cards.
A player's dynasty deck must contain a minimum of 30
cards and a maximum of 40 cards. Each of these cards must
be in-clan or neutral.
A player's conflict deck must contain a minimum of 30
cards and a maximum of 40 cards. Each of these cards must
be in-clan or neutral, or be purchased from a single other
clan by using influence. (Each player has 6 influence with
which to purchase out-of-clan cards during deckbuilding.)
No more than 2 copies of a single card by title can be
included in any combination in a player's dynasty and
conflict decks.
For tournament play, each player may include up to 10
additional cards in their "sideboard," which can be used to
modify the contents of their decks in between games in a
single match. The contents of a players' decks and
sideboard combined must follow all rules outlined above.
Deck Limits
Up to 3 total copies of most cards (by title) may be included in a
player's dynasty and/or conflict decks (2 copies instead in skirmish
format). Each copy of a card in either deck counts towards this
limit.
If a card has the text "Limit X per deck" no more than X copies of
that card may be included in that player's dynasty and/or conflict
decks.
If X is less than the standard number of allowed copies, this
phrase acts as a deckbuilding restriction.
If X is greater than the standard number of allowed copies, this
phrase acts as a permission that enables a player to include
more than the standard number of copies.
Defender, Defending Character, Defending
Player
The term "defending character" refers to a character that is
participating in a conflict on the side of the player who controls the

10
province that is being attacked. The term "defender" is also used
as shorthand for "defending character."
The term "defending player" refers to the opponent of the
attacking player against whom (from the attacking player's
perspective) a conflict is resolving.
Delayed Effects
Some abilities contain delayed effects. Such abilities specify a
future timing point, or indicate a future condition that may arise,
and dictate an effect that is to happen at that time.
Delayed effects resolve automatically and immediately after
their specified timing point or future condition occurs or
becomes true, before reactions to that moment may be
triggered.
When a delayed effect resolves, it is not treated as a new
triggered ability, even if the delayed effect was originally
created by a triggered ability.
When a delayed effect resolves, it is still considered to be an
ability originating from the card type of the card that created
the delayed effect.
Dire
Dire is a variable keyword ability. A card with this keyword gains an
additional ability while that character has no fate on it.
Most uses of the dire keyword grant a constant ability that is
active while the character has no fate on it. Some may instead
grant triggered abilities that can only be used while the
character has no fate on it.
Discard Piles
The discard piles are out-of-play areas. Each player has a dynasty
discard pile and a conflict discard pile.
Any time a card is discarded (from play, or from an out-of-play
area such as a hand or deck), it is placed faceup on top of its
owner's appropriate discard pile: dynasty cards are discarded
to the dynasty discard pile, and conflict cards are discarded to
the conflict discard pile.
Each player's discard pile is open information and may be
looked at by any player at any time.
The order of cards in a player's discard pile may be changed by
that player.
Disguised
The disguised keyword appears on unique characters. When a

character is played using the disguised keyword, it replaces a non-
unique character of the correct Trait or clan affiliation, inheriting

all of that character's attachments, fate, and status tokens. This is
an alternate means by which to play a character and carries a
number of unique rules including, but not limited to, an additional
cost of choosing and discarding a non-unique character to discard
when the disguised character enters play.
When playing a character using the disguised keyword, you
may play that character during the conflict phase, following all
timing rules which apply to playing characters from hand.
To play a character using the disguised keyword, you must
choose a non-unique character you control of the appropriate

Trait or clan affiliation as an additional cost to play the
character. Reduce the cost to play the disguised character by
the printed cost of the chosen character, pay that cost, the
disguised character enters play, then move all attachments and
tokens (fate, status, etc.) from the chosen character to the
disguised character. Finally, discard the chosen character from
play. Interrupts cannot be used to replace or prevent this
discard.
When playing a character using the disguised keyword you
cannot put additional fate from your fate pool on it.
A character played using this keyword enters play ready and in
the same location as the non-unique character it is replacing.
Dishonored, Dishonored Status Token
See "Personal Honor, Personal Dishonor".
Drawing cards
When a player is instructed to draw one or more cards, those cards
are drawn from the top of his or her conflict deck.
When a player draws 2 or more cards as the result of a single
ability or game step, those cards are drawn simultaneously.
Drawn cards are added to a player's hand.
There is no limit to the number of cards a player may draw each
round.
There is no maximum hand size.

Duel
Some card abilities initiate a duel between two (or more)
characters. For the rules on how to initiate and resolve a duel, see
"D. Duel Timing".
Most card abilities that initiate a duel use the phrase "initiate
a [type] duel." The characters chosen during duel initiation are
considered to be chosen as targets of the ability that initiates
the duel.
Duplicates
A duplicate is a copy (in a player's hand or provinces) of a unique
character that is already in play and under the same player's
control. A player may, as a player action during step 1.4 of the
dynasty phase, discard a duplicate from his or her hand or
provinces to place 1 fate on the copy of the character in play.
After discarding a duplicate from a province, the province refills
face down.
A different version of a unique card (that shares the same title)
may be discarded from a player's hand or provinces as a
duplicate.

Effects
A card effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of ability
text printed on or gained by a card. A framework effect is any effect
that arises from the resolution of a framework step.

11
Card effects might be preceded by costs, triggering conditions,
play restrictions or permissions, and/or targeting
requirements. Such elements are not considered effects.
Once an ability is initiated, players must resolve as much of
each aspect of its effect as they are able, unless the effect uses
the word "may."
When a non-targeting effect attempts to engage a number of
entities (such as "search the top 10 cards of your conflict deck")
that exceeds the number of entities that currently exist in the
specified game area, the effect engages as many entities as
possible.
The expiration of a lasting effect (or the cessation of a constant
ability) is not considered to be generating a game state change
by a card effect.
If an ability instructs a player to pick among multiple effects, an
effect that has the potential to change the game state must be
picked.
Unless an effect uses the word "then" or the phrase "if you do,"
all effects of a card ability are resolved simultaneously. The
decision whether to resolve any optional effects (usually
indicated by the word "may") is made before applying the
results of the ability's effects.
Eminent
Eminent is a keyword ability that can be found on province cards.
A province with this keyword cannot be a player's stronghold
province, starts the game faceup, and cannot be turned facedown.
Enters Play
The phrase "enters play" refers to any time a card makes a
transition from an out-of-play area or state into play. Playing a card
and putting a card into play by using a card ability are two means
by which a card may enter play.
Event Cards
Event cards represent tactical acts and maneuvers, court intrigues,
spells, supernatural occurrences, and other unexpected
developments that might occur during a game.
Event cards are triggered from a player's hand or provinces. An
event card's ability type, triggering condition (if any), and play
permissions/restrictions (if any), and originating location
define when and how the card may be played.
Event cards with action abilities may be played from a player's
hand during any action window.
In the skirmish format, event cards with action abilities
cannot be played from a player's hand during the dynasty
phase.
Event cards played from a player's provinces cannot be played
outside of the dynasty phase.
When an event card is played, its costs are paid, its effects are
resolved (or canceled), and it is placed in its owner's
appropriate discard pile prior to opening the reaction window
which follows the ability's resolution.
Lasting effects, including those created by event cards engage
the game state at the time they resolve. If an event card creates
a lasting effect on a set of cards, only cards that are in play (or
in the affected game area or game state) at the time the event

is played are eligible to be affected. Cards that enter play (or
the affected game area or game state) after the resolution of
the event are not affected by its lasting effect.
If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still
considered to have been played, and its costs remain paid, and
the card is still discarded. Only the effects have been canceled.
Unless the ability that puts it into play also changes its cardtype
to a cardtype that is permitted in play, an event card cannot
enter play.
For event card anatomy, see "Appendix II: Card Anatomy".
Facedown Province
A facedown province card has no inherent identity other than
"facedown province." When a facedown province is turned faceup,
that province card is considered to be revealed.
A facedown province is turned faceup when an attack is
declared against it.
A player may look at the facedown provinces under his or her
control at any time. Note: this rule refers to the facedown
province card itself. A player is not permitted to look at
facedown dynasty cards in his or her provinces.
If a facedown province becomes the attacked province in a
manner other than the declaration of an attack, immediately
turn the province faceup.
A facedown province is considered to be a different entity than
its faceup side. While a province is facedown, its faceup side is
considered to be out of play. When a province is turned faceup,
the "faceup province" and "facedown province"
simultaneously exchange positions, such that the facedown
province is now out of play and the faceup province is now in
play. The opposite is true when a province is turned facedown.
Province tokens in the skirmish format are never considered to
be facedown and are never revealed.
Fate
Fate is the game's basic resource, and is used to
pay for cards and some card abilities. The
amount of fate a player has available at any
given time is represented (as open information)
by fate tokens in his or her fate pool.
Fate begins the game in the general token pool. When a player
gains fate, that player takes that much fate from the general
token pool and adds it to his or her fate pool.
When a player is instructed to place fate on a card, that fate
comes from the general token pool unless otherwise specified.
When fate is spent or lost, it is usually returned to the general
token pool. If fate is spent to a ring, it is placed on that ring.
Whenever a player plays a character from his or her hand or
provinces, after that character enters play, that player has the
option of placing any number of fate from his or her fate pool
onto that character.
During the fate phase, each character with no fate on it is
discarded. Subsequently, 1 fate is removed from each
character in play. Finally, 1 fate from the general token pool is
placed on each unclaimed ring.

12

Fill a Province
If a player is instructed to fill a province, that player takes the top
card of their dynasty deck and places it facedown (without looking
at it) on the province.
A player can fill a province even if that province already has 1
or more dynasty cards in it.
If a player is instructed to fill a province faceup, the dynasty
card is placed in the province faceup rather than facedown.
First Player, First Player Token
A first player is chosen during setup, and the first
player token is used to indicate that player's status
as the first player. The chosen player remains first
player until they pass the first player token to the
player on their left during the fate phase.
The first player becomes the active player first
during the dynasty phase and the conflict
phase.
The first player has the first opportunity to initiate actions or
act first during all non-conflict resolution action windows.
While a conflict is resolving, the defending player has the first
opportunity to initiate actions during each conflict resolution
action window.
The first player has the first opportunity to initiate interrupt or
reaction abilities at each appropriate game moment.
For any question as to who should perform an act or make a
decision first, in the absence of any other direction by card or
rules text, the first player does so first, followed by the player
to the first player's left and continuing in clockwise order.
In the team conquest format, the first player token is given to
a team rather than a player. Each player on that team is
considered to be the first player. During action windows, each
team has an action opportunity (rather than each player).
When a team wishes to take an action, one of the players on
that team takes the action, then a player on the opposing team
has an opportunity to take an action. This continues until both
teams pass in sequence, and the action window closes.
At the end of the fate phase, the first player token is passed
to the opposing team, and they become the firstplayer
team.

Appendix I
Forced (Forced Interrupts, Forced Reactions)
While most triggered abilities are optional, some interrupt and
reaction abilities are preceded by the word "Forced." Such abilities
must be resolved immediately whenever the triggering condition
specified in the ability text occurs.
For any given triggering condition, forced interrupts take
priority and initiate before non-forced interrupts, and forced
reactions take priority and initiate before non-forced reactions.
If two or more forced and/or mandatory abilities (such as
keywords) would initiate at the same moment, the first player
determines the order in which the abilities initiate, regardless
of who controls the cards bearing those abilities.

Each forced ability must resolve completely before the next
forced ability to the same triggering condition may initiate.
Related: Interrupts, Reactions
Framework Effects and Framework Steps
A framework step is a mandatory occurrence, dictated by the
structure of the game. A framework effect is any effect that arises
from the resolution of a framework step.
Related: Appendix I
The word "Gaijin"
The word "Gaijin" is a slur in modern Japanese and some people
might be offended by it. On Emerald Legacy cards, the Gaijin trait
will be replaced by Foreign. For gameplay purposes, both traits are
equivalent.
If an existing card has the Gaijin trait, it is also considered to
have the Foreign trait.
If a card interacts with the Gaijin trait, it interacts with the
Foreign trait in the exact same way.
Example: When you play a card with the Foreign trait, you can
use the reaction on Worldly Shiotome (Atonement, 126) as if
you had played a card with the Gaijin trait.
Gains
The word "gains" is used in multiple contexts.
If a player gains fate or honor, that player takes the specified
amount of fate or honor and adds it to their fate pool or honor
pool. Unless that player is gaining the fate or honor from a
specific source, the token is taken from the general token pool.
If a card gains a characteristic (such as a Trait, a keyword, or
ability text), the card functions as if it possesses the gained
characteristic. Gained characteristics are not considered to be
printed on the card.
Related: Give, Loses, Printed, Take
Give
If a player is instructed to give tokens to another player, those
tokens are removed from the giving player's pool of tokens (or
specified game area), and are added to the other player's token
pool.
The player giving the tokens is considered to be losing the tokens
and the other player is considered to be gaining the tokens.
Related: Gains, Loses, Take
Glory
Glory is a character statistic that represents a character's
reputation, and how much the character cares about their
reputation.
While a character is honored or dishonored, that character's
glory will modify its military and political skill.
A player counts the glory value of each ready character he or
she controls whenever a glory count is required.

13
Related: Personal Honor, Personal Dishonor, Glory Count
Glory Count
When the players are asked to perform a glory count, each player
or each team counts the total glory value among the ready
characters they control and adds 1 to the total for each ring in their
claimed ring pool. The player or team with the highest total wins
the glory count.
Step 3.4.1 of the conflict phase consists of a framework glory
count. The winner of this count claims the Imperial Favor and
may set it to either side if appropriate.
If players have the same total, the Imperial Favor remains
in its current state (either unclaimed or under the
possession of the player who currently has it, remaining set
on its current side).
Some card abilities may require the players to perform a glory
count. Glory counts required by card abilities are made in the
same manner, and the ability will detail how to process the
result. Such counts do not affect the status of the Imperial
Favor, unless the ability text causes the Imperial Favor status
to change.
Other card abilities may require players to count current glory
among their characters, or a subset of their characters. This is
different from a glory count, and rings in a player's claimed ring
pool are not added. For such card abilities, players count
current glory among their specified characters in the same way
they would count current or skill.
Related: Imperial Favor, Current
Holding
When a holding is turned faceup in a player's province, its game
text becomes active and that holding is considered to be "in play."
As long as a holding remains faceup in a player's province, that
player can use abilities or benefit from game text on that holding.
Many holdings have a statistical value that modifies the
defense strength of the province at which the holding is
located.
During the regroup phase, when discarding faceup cards from
his or her provinces, a player may choose to discard a faceup
holding. When this occurs, the province is refilled, facedown,
with the top card of that player's Dynasty deck, as normal.
While a holding remains on a province, that province is not
refilled.
For holding card anatomy, see "Appendix II: Card Anatomy".
Home, Move Home
Character cards that are in play but not currently participating in a
conflict are considered to be in their controller's home area.
If a character that is participating in a conflict is moved home,
it is removed from the conflict and placed in its controller's
home area. A character that is moved home maintains its
status of bowed or readied.

Honor
Honor represents the behavior of a player's
clan, and the outward perception of that
behavior. It is bid during the draw phase (see
framework step "2.2. Honor bid") and during
duels. Honor also serves as a victory track to
measure an honor win or an honor loss. The
amount of honor a player has at any given time
is represented (as open information) by honor tokens in his or her
honor pool.
A player's stronghold indicates that player's starting honor
total. In the skirmish format, each player starts with 6 honor.
Each time a player gains honor, that honor is taken from the
general token pool and added to the player's honor pool. Each
time a player loses honor, that honor is taken from the player's
honor pool and returned to the general token pool.
If a card ability references a player who is more or less
honorable than another player, the players compare the
amount of honor in each of their honor pools to determine if
the ability is applicable, or to whom the ability refers.
If a card ability references a player's honor bid, the ability is
referencing the current setting on the player's honor dial.
Related: Winning the Game
Honored, Honored Status Token
See "Personal Honor, Personal Dishonor".
Immune
If a card is immune to a specified set of effects (for example,
"immune to ring effects" or "immune to event card effects"), it
cannot be targeted or affected by effects that belong to that set.
Immunity only protects the immune card itself. Peripheral
entities associated with an immune card (such as attachments,
tokens on the card, and abilities that originate from the
immune card) are not themselves immune.
If a card gains immunity to an effect, pre-existing lasting effects
that have been applied to the card are not removed.
Immunity only protects a card from effects. It does not prevent
a card from being used to pay costs.
Imperial Favor, Imperial Favor Contest
The Imperial Favor represents which player currently holds the
favor of the Emperor. Step 3.4.1 of the conflict phase consists of a
framework glory count. The winner of this count claims the
Imperial Favor and may set it to either side if appropriate.
The +1 skill modifier granted by the Imperial Favor applies to
any conflict of the specified type in which its bearer controls at
least one participating character. This modifier applies to the
player's total skill that is counted for the conflict, but does not
modify the skill value of any of the characters participating in
the conflict.
Once the Imperial Favor is set to its military or political side, it
must remain on that side until it is claimed again or changed by
a card ability.

14
If a player in possession of the Imperial Favor wins the
framework glory count in the conflict phase, that player claims
the Imperial Favor again and may set it to either side.
If players have the same total, the Imperial Favor remains in its
current state (either unclaimed or under the possession of the
player who currently has it, remaining set on its current side).
The game begins with the Imperial Favor unclaimed.
If a card ability causes the Imperial Favor to be claimed, it may
be claimed from its unclaimed status, or claimed from a player.
Each time the Imperial Favor is claimed, it may be set to either
side.
If a player is instructed to discard the Imperial Favor, that
player returns the Imperial Favor to its unclaimed state in the
token bank.
In the skirmish format, the Imperial Favor is not set to a side as
described above. Instead, the +1 skill modifier granted by the
Imperial Favor applies to each conflict in which its bearer
controls at least one participating character, regardless of
conflict type.
Related: Glory Count
In Play and Out of Play
The cards (generally characters and attachments) that a player
controls in his or her play area (at home or participating in a
conflict), a player's stronghold card, a player's faceup province
cards, and all holdings on a player's provinces are considered "in
play." A player's facedown provinces are considered in play only as
"facedown provinces," and the ability text on such cards is not
considered active until the card is revealed.
"Out-of-play" refers to all other cards and areas involved in the
game environment, including: character cards in a player's
provinces, role cards, cards in a player's hand, decks, discard piles,
and any cards that have been removed from the game.
A card enters play when it transitions from an out-of-play origin
to an in-play state.
A card leaves play when it transitions from an in-play state to
an out-of-play destination.
A player's stronghold cannot leave play.
If a card enters or leaves play, any lasting effects, delayed
effects, or pending effects that are currently or about to
interact with that card no longer do so. This is also true if a card
transitions from one out-of-play area to another (such as going
from hand to discard pile).
If a card would enter a deck of the incorrect deck type (conflict
or dynasty), it is put into the discard pile of its owner
corresponding to its correct deck type instead.
If a dynasty card would enter a player's hand of conflict cards,
it is put into its owner's discard pile instead.
If a conflict card would enter a player's provinces, it is put into
its owner's conflict discard pile instead.
Related: Enters Play, Leaves Play, Play and Put Into Play
Influence, Influence Cost
Influence is a deckbuilding resource that is indicated by a player's
chosen stronghold for that deck. Many conflict deck cards have an

influence cost, which makes them eligible for selection as an out-
of-clan card.

In the skirmish format, each player cannot spend more than 6
influence to include out-of-clan cards in their deck.
A player may spend influence up to the amount indicated by
his or her stronghold to include out-of-clan cards from a single
additional clan in his or her conflict deck.
Each copy of a card that is chosen reduces the amount of
influence a player has at his or her disposal to use in selecting
other cards for the deck.
A clan-affiliated card that has no influence cost cannot be
selected using influence for inclusion in a deck.
Example: Tom is building a Lion Clan deck, and has 10 influence to
spend on out-of-clan cards, as indicated by the Lion stronghold,
Shiro no Yojin. He must spend all of his influence on cards from a
single clan. He chooses to select cards from the Crane Clan. Tom
decides to include 3 copies of Admit Defeat (2 influence cost each),
3 copies of The Perfect Gift (1 influence cost each), and 1 copy of
Duelist Training (1 influence cost). As this is all of Tom's influence,
he cannot include any other Crane Clan cards in his conflict deck.
All of the other cards in Tom's conflict deck must either be from the
Lion Clan, or be neutral.
Initiating Abilities / Playing Cards
Whenever a player wishes to play a card or initiate a triggered
ability, that player first declares his or her intent (and shows the
card to be used, if necessary). There are two preliminary
confirmations that must be made before the process may begin.
These are:
1. Check play restrictions and verify the existence of eligible
targets: can the card be played, or the ability initiated, at this
time? If the play restrictions are not met, or there are not
enough eligible targets for the ability, the process cannot
proceed.
2. Determine the cost (or costs, if multiple costs are required) to
play the card or initiate the ability. If it is established that the
cost (taking modifiers into account) can be paid, proceed with
the remaining steps of this sequence.
Once each of the preliminary confirmations has been made, follow
these steps, in order:
3. Apply any modifiers to the cost(s).
4. Pay the cost(s).
5. Choose target(s), if applicable. Any pre-effect instructions to
"select" among multiple options in the ability are made at this
time as well.
6. The card attempts to enter play, or the effects of the ability
attempt to initiate. An interrupt ability that cancels this
initiation may be used at this time.
7. The card enters play, or the effects of the ability (if not canceled
in step 6) complete their initiation, and resolve.
8. At this time the card is considered "played" or the ability
"triggered."
Interrupts and reactions may be used throughout this process as
normal, should their triggering conditions occur.

15

In Player Order
If the players are instructed to perform a sequence "in player
order," the first player performs their part of the sequence first,
followed by the player to the first player's left and continuing in
clockwise order.
If a sequence performed in player order does not conclude
after each player has performed their aspect of the sequence
once, the sequence of opportunities continues to alternate
from player to player in clockwise order until it is complete.
Interrupts
An interrupt is a triggered ability whose text is prefaced by a
boldface "Interrupt:" precursor. An interrupt ability interrupts the
resolution of its triggering condition, sometimes canceling or
changing the resolution of that condition. Always resolve
interrupts to a triggering condition before resolving the
consequences of the triggering condition itself.
Unlike actions, which are resolved during action windows, an
interrupt may be initiated only if its specified triggering condition
occurs, as described in the interrupt ability's text.
When a triggering condition initiates (but before it completes its
resolution), an interrupt window for that triggering condition
opens.
Within the interrupt window, the first player always has the first
opportunity to initiate an eligible interrupt (to the triggering
condition that opened the window), or pass. Opportunities to
initiate an eligible interrupt, or pass, continue to alternate between
the players until all players consecutively pass, at which point the
interrupt window closes. Passing does not prevent a player from
initiating an eligible interrupt later in that same interrupt window.
Once an interrupt window closes, further interrupts to that specific
triggering condition cannot be initiated. The triggering condition
now completes its resolution (as long as its effects have not been
canceled).
Unless otherwise noted by the ability, each interrupt ability
may be initiated once each round. (This includes forced
interrupts.)
An interrupt with specified limit that enables it to be triggered
more than once per round may only be initiated once each time
its specified triggering condition occurs.
If multiple players can trigger an interrupt ability, each may
do so to the same triggering condition.
Keywords
A keyword is a card ability which conveys specific rules to its card.
The keywords in the game are: Ancestral, Composure, Courtesy,
Covert, Disguised, Eminent, Legendary X, Limited, No
Attachments, Pride, Rally, Restricted, Sincerity, and Support.
Sometimes a keyword is followed by reminder text, which is
presented in italics. Reminder text is a shorthand explanation
of how a keyword works, but it is not rules text and does not
replace the rules for that keyword in this glossary.
Keywords that resolve based on the occurrence of a triggering
condition (such as a character leaving play) resolve
immediately after the triggering condition occurs, before
triggering any reaction abilities.

A card can have multiple instances of the same keyword.
However, a card that does so functions as if it has one instance
of that keyword, and the keyword will only resolve once per
triggering condition. Variable keywords (see below) are an
exception: if a card has multiple instances of a variable
keyword, each of those instances acts on the card
independently.
Some keywords, such as Composure, are variable keywords.
Variable keywords operate in the same way as other keywords,
but their effects are unique on a card-by-card basis. Each
variable keyword has the same condition in which they become
active, but different effects based on the individual card's text.
Lasting Effects
Some abilities create conditions that affect the game state for a
specified duration. Such effects are known as lasting effects.
A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that
created it, for the duration specified by the effect. The effect
continues to affect the game state for the specified duration
regardless of whether the card that created the lasting effect is
or remains in play.
If a lasting effect affects in-play cards (or a specified set of
cards), it is only applied to cards that are in play (or that meet
the specifications of the set) at the time the lasting effect is
established. Cards that enter play (or change status to meet the
criteria of the specified set) after a lasting effect's
establishment are not affected by that lasting effect.
A lasting effect expires as soon as the timing point specified by
its duration is reached. This means that an "until the end of the
phase" lasting effect expires before an "at the end of the
phase" ability or delayed effect may initiate.
A lasting effect that expires at the end of a specified time
period can only be initiated during that time period.
Leaves Play
The phrase "leaves play" refers to any time a card makes a
transition from an in-play state to an out-of-play destination.
If a card leaves play, the following consequences occur
simultaneously with the card leaving play:
All tokens on the card are returned to the general token pool.
All non-ancestral attachments on the card are discarded. All
ancestral attachments on the card are returned to their
owners' hands.
All lasting effects and/or delayed effects affecting the card
while it was in play expire for that card.
Legendary X
Some characters are shrouded in legend and mystery. These
characters are given the Legendary keyword. It consists of the word
"Legendary" followed by a variable, numerical value X, that can be
0 or higher.
Legendary X means: "This card enters play with X fate on it and
cannot have more than X fate on it. Fate cannot be added to this
card. It cannot be put into play or prevented from leaving play by
card effects, and cannot enter play outside of the Dynasty phase."

16

Limited
Limited is a keyword ability. As an additional cost to play a card
with the limited keyword, a player must bow their role card, this
means that no more than one card in total with the limited
keyword can be played by each player each round. Cards played
from hand and played from a player's provinces are restricted by
and count toward this limit.
Limited cards that are "put into play" via card abilities ignore
and are ignored by this restriction.
Limit X per [period]
This phrase specifies the number of times a triggered ability can be
used during the designated period. This replaces the general
restriction of using a triggered ability once per game round.
Each copy of an ability with a specified limit may be used the
specified number of times during the specified period.
If a card leaves play and re-enters play during the same period,
or if a card transitions from one out-of-play area to another
(such as going from hand to discard pile), it is considered a new
instance of the card. There is no memory of having used the
ability during the specified period for any new instance of a
card.
All limits are player specific.
If the effects of an ability with a limit are canceled, the use of
the ability is still counted against the limit.
Related: Limits of Triggered Abilities, Max X per [period]
Limits of Triggered Abilities
Unless otherwise specified, each triggered ability can only be used
once per game round. This general restriction applies to any
triggered ability that does not have "Limit X per [period]" printed
as part of the ability's text.
If a card leaves play and re-enters play during the same period,
or if a card transitions from one out-of-play area to another
(such as going from hand to discard pile), it is considered a new
instance of the card. There is no memory of having used the
ability for any new instance of a card for the purposes of this
general restriction.
If a card triggers its ability from a hidden out-of-play area (such
as a hand or deck) but does not leave that hidden area, that
ability may be triggered again because it is considered a new
instance of the card.
All limits are player specific.
If the effects of an ability are canceled, the use of the ability is
still counted against the general restriction of only once per
game round.
Related: Limit X per [period], Max X per [period]
Loses
If a player loses fate or honor, that player takes the specified
amount of fate or honor and removes it from their fate pool or
honor pool. Unless that player is moving the fate or honor to a
specific destination, the token is returned to the general token
pool.

When tokens are removed from a card, that card is considered
to lose those tokens. If the tokens are not moved to a specific
destination, return them to the general token pool.
Related: Gains, Give, Take
Max X per [period]
This phrase imposes a maximum number of times that an ability
may be initiated from all copies (by title) of cards bearing the ability
(including itself), during the designated period. Initiating an ability
on a card counts toward the maximum for all copies of that card.
Each maximum is player specific.
If the effects of a card or ability with a maximum are canceled,
the use of the card or ability is still counted against the
maximum.
An ability's maximum value cannot be modified.
Related: Limit X per [period], Limits of Triggered Abilities
May
The word "may" indicates that a specified player has the option to
do that which follows. If no player is specified, the option is granted
to the controller of the card with the ability in question.
Modifiers
Some abilities may ask players to modify values. The game state
constantly checks and (if necessary) updates the count of any
variable quantity that is being modified.
Any time a new modifier is applied (or removed), the entire
quantity is recalculated from the start, considering the unmodified
base value and all active modifiers.
The calculation of a value treats all modifiers as being applied
simultaneously. However, while performing the calculation, all
additive and subtractive modifiers should be calculated before
doubling and/or halving modifiers are calculated.
Fractional values are rounded up after all modifiers have been
applied.
When a value is "set" to a specific number, the set modifier
overrides all non-set modifiers (including any new non-set
modifiers that are added during the duration of the set value).
If multiple set modifiers are in conflict, the most recently
applied set modifier takes precedence.
A quantity cannot be reduced so that it functions with a value
below zero: a card cannot have negative icons, political or
military skill, glory, traits, cost, or keywords. Negative modifiers
that would take a value below zero can be applied, but, after
all active modifiers have been applied, any resultant value
below zero is treated as zero.
If a value "cannot be increased/decreased," any modifiers to
that value that would increase/decrease it are ignored for the
duration of the "cannot be increased/decreased" effect, even
if those modifiers were applied before applying the "cannot be
increased/decreased" effect.
"Set" modifiers are not ignored, as they do not directly
increase/decrease the value.

17

Move
Some abilities allow players to move cards or tokens.
When an entity moves, it cannot move to its same (current)
placement. If there is no valid destination for a move, the move
attempt cannot be made.
When a character is moved into a conflict, that character is
considered participating in the conflict on its controller's side.
Mulligan
During setup, each player has a single opportunity to mulligan any
number of cards in his or her provinces, and a single opportunity
to mulligan any number of cards in his or her hand. When a player
decides to mulligan, the mulliganed cards are set aside, replaced
with an equal number of cards from the top of the appropriate
deck(s), and then shuffled back into the deck(s) from which they
originated.
Players mulligan (or pass the opportunity to do so) in player
order. If the first player passes an opportunity to mulligan, that
player cannot change his or her mind and then decide to
mulligan during that step after seeing the opponent's decision.
After a player mulligans the cards in their provinces, they may
look at the new cards before drawing their conflict hand.
Nested Ability Sequences
Each time a triggering condition occurs, the following sequence is
followed: (1) execute any interrupts to that triggering condition, (2)
resolve the triggering condition itself, and then, (3) execute any
reactions to that triggering condition.
Within this sequence, if the use of an interrupt or reaction leads to
a new triggering condition, the game pauses and starts a new
sequence: (1) execute interrupts to the new triggering condition,
(2) resolve the new triggering condition itself, and then, (3) execute
reactions to the new triggering condition. This is called a nested
sequence. Once this nested sequence is completed, the game
returns to where it left off, continuing with the original triggering
condition's sequence.
It is possible that a nested sequence generates further triggering
conditions (and hence more nested sequences). There is no limit to
the number of nested sequences that may occur, but each nested
sequence must complete before returning to the sequence that
spawned it. In effect, these sequences are resolved in a Last In, First
Out (LIFO) manner.
Related: Interrupts, Reactions
Neutral
Some cards are not affiliated with any clan, these cards are neutral.
Any deck may include neutral cards.
Neutral cards are not considered to be in-clan or out-of-clan.
No Attachments
No attachments is a keyword ability. A card with this keyword
cannot have an attachment card attached.
If one or more traits precedes the word "attachments" (for
example, "No Weapon or Armor attachments"), the card
cannot have an attachment that possess one or more of the

specified traits, but it can have attachments possessing none of
those traits.
If the word "attachments" is followed by the word "except" and
one or more traits (for example, "No attachments except
Weapon"), the card can have attachments that possess one or
more of the specified traits, but it cannot have attachments
possessing none of those traits.
If a card has multiple variants of the "No attachments"
keyword, any variant that would prevent a card from having a
given attachment prevails.
Opponent
In the stronghold format, as well as most games of the skirmish
format, each player has only one opponent.
In the enlightenment format, where each player has two
opponents, a player's card ability that refers to "your opponent"
only refers to the single opponent participating against that player
in a conflict. It does not refer to the player not participating in the
conflict.
In the team conquest format, where all players can control
participating characters in a conflict, a player's card ability that
refers to "your opponent" or "an opponent" refers to either player
on the opposing team, chosen when resolving the card ability.
Ordinary
See "Personal Honor, Personal Dishonor".
Own, Ownership
See "Control and Ownership".
Participating and Cannot Participate
Any character that has been declared as an attacker or defender
for a conflict is considered participating in that conflict through its
resolution, unless it is removed by an ability or game effect.
Each character that is in play is either participating or not
participating in each conflict.
If an ability removes a character from a conflict or moves a
character home, that character is no longer participating in the
conflict and is returned to its controller's home area.
If a non-participating character is moved into a conflict, it is
considered participating on its controller's side.
If a participating character is bowed, it is still considered
participating, but will not contribute its skill toward the
resolution of the conflict while in a bowed state.
If a participating character leaves play for any reason, it is no
longer participating in the conflict.
A character played directly into a conflict from a player's hand
is participating in the conflict. The controller of the character
must indicate that this is the case when the character is played.
If a character "cannot participate" in a conflict, that character
cannot be declared as an attacker or defender for, move into,
be played into, or put into play in that conflict. If an already
participating character gains "cannot participate" status during
a conflict, move it home bowed.

18
In the enlightenment format, only two players can control
participating characters: one attacking player and one
defending player. The third player in the game may take
actions to influence the outcome of the conflict, but they
cannot play or move characters to the conflict on either side
(except as indicated by card effects).
In the team conquest format, all four players can control
participating characters. Characters controlled by players on
the same team participate on the same side of the conflict and
contribute their skill towards the same total.
If a conflict does not have two participating players, it cannot
resolve. Therefore, if a player is eliminated from the game in
the middle of a conflict and the game does not end, the conflict
immediately ends with no winner. Return the ring to the
attacker's unclaimed ring pool (or the common unclaimed ring
pool, as appropriate) and each participating character
controlled by the remaining player returns home bowed.
Pass
There are times in the game at which a player has an option to
perform an act (such as taking an action, triggering an ability, or
executing a game step), or to pass. Passing in such a situation
forfeits the player's right to perform that act in that moment.
The first player to pass the opportunity to use an action or play
a card during the dynasty phase forfeits the opportunity to do
so for the remainder of the phase, and gains one fate.
Other game sequences in which players have the option to pass
continue until both players pass consecutively. If the first
player passes, and the second player does not, the opportunity
returns to the first player in the sequence. The sequence only
ends when both players have passed in succession. (In other
words, passing in such a sequence does not prevent a player
from re-entering the sequence should the opponent not also
pass in succession.)
When passing an opportunity to declare a conflict, a player is
not required to specify which type of conflict he or she is
passing.
Personal Honor, Personal Dishonor
Personal honor is a means of tracking the honored or dishonored
status of individual character cards. Each character exists in one of
three states:
Honored
Ordinary
Dishonored
Characters enter play with ordinary status. Honored status tokens
and dishonored status tokens are used to track the state of a
character that receives a status other than ordinary.
When a character is honored, it receives an honored status
token to indicate its honored status. An honored character
adds its glory value to both its military and political skill so long
as it possesses that token. When an honored character leaves
play its controller gains 1 honor.
When a character is dishonored, it receives a dishonored status
token to indicate its dishonored status. A dishonored character
subtracts its glory value from both its military and political skill
so long as it possesses that token. When a dishonored
character leaves play its controller loses 1 honor.

When an honored character is dishonored, it loses its honored
status, discards the status token, and returns to ordinary
status. Likewise, when a dishonored character is honored, it
loses its dishonored status, discards the status token, and
returns to ordinary status.
A character with an honored status token cannot become
honored. A character with a dishonored status token cannot
become dishonored.
Should a character have both an honored status token and a
dishonored status token at the same time, discard both tokens.
The character returns to the ordinary state.
If a character enters play honored or dishonored, abilities
cannot be triggered from that character becoming honored or
dishonored, as it enters play already with that status.
Play and Put into Play
Playing a character or attachment card involves paying the card's
fate cost and placing the card in the play area. This causes the card
to enter play. Cards are played from a player's hand or provinces.
Any time a character card is played, its controller has the option of
placing additional fate from his or her fate pool on the card.
Some card abilities put cards into play. This bypasses the need to
pay the card's cost, as well as the opportunity to place additional
fate on the card. A card that is put into play bypasses any
restrictions or prohibitions regarding the potential of playing that
card. A card that is put into play enters play in its controller's play
area.
A card that has been put into play is not considered to have
been "played."
In order to play a card, its fate cost (after modifiers) must be
paid.
When a card is put into play, its fate cost is ignored.
Unless otherwise instructed by the put into play effect,
characters that enter play in this manner do so ready and at
home. Non-character cards that enter play in this manner must
do so in a play area or state that matches the rules of playing
the card.
When an event card is played, place it on the table, then pay
its cost, resolve its ability, and place the card in its owner's
discard pile. The event is not in your hand (or province) while
paying its cost. If the cost of an event is (partially) prevented,
it is still placed in its owners corresponding discard pile.
No card in a player's conflict or dynasty deck can be played
from that deck unless by a card effect that specifically
references playing the card from that deck.
Play Restrictions and Permissions
Many cards or abilities contain specific instructions pertaining to
when or how they may or may not be used, or to specific conditions
that must be true in order to use them. In order to use such an
ability or to play such a card, all play restrictions must be observed.
A permission is a variant of a play restriction that provides a player
with additional options as to how the card may be played or used,
outside of the game's general specification regarding how the card
or ability would normally be used.

19

Player Elimination
In most game formats, players are eliminated from the game when
certain conditions are met. Once a player is eliminated from the
game, all cards that player owns are immediately removed from
the game, and their honor dial is ignored for the purposes of card
abilities for the rest of the game. If, after a player is eliminated,
only one player remains in the game, that player is the game's
winner.
If a player is eliminated from an enlightenment format game,
perform the following steps:
Any ring tokens an eliminated player had claimed on their
provinces, or that are in the eliminated player's personal
unclaimed ring pool, are placed in the common unclaimed
ring pool.
If the eliminated player was the first player, the first player
token immediately passes to the player on the eliminated
player's left.
Any treaties made by the eliminated player are
immediately dissolved.
Players are not eliminated from a team conquest format game
until their entire team loses. If a player's stronghold province is
broken, they continue to play, with the following penalties:
Treat the printed text box of that player's stronghold as if
it were blank (except for Traits).
That player cannot bid more than two during honor bids.
That player cannot reshuffle either of their decks if those
decks run out of cards.
If a player reaches zero honor, their stronghold province is
immediately broken.
Broken stronghold provinces are immune to all card
effects.
Pride
Pride is a keyword ability. After a character with the pride keyword
wins a conflict, honor that character. After a character with the
pride keyword loses a conflict, dishonor that character.
The pride keyword resolves after the character wins or loses a
conflict, before reactions to that conflict being won or loss can
be triggered.
Printed
The word printed refers to the text, characteristic, icon, or value
that is physically printed on the card.
Priority of Simultaneous Resolution
If a single effect affects multiple players simultaneously, but the
players must individually make choices to resolve the effect, the
first player chooses first, followed by his or her opponent. Once all
necessary choices have been made, the effect resolves
simultaneously upon all affected entities.
If the resolution of two or more delayed effects or forced
abilities would resolve at the same time, the first player decides
the order in which the abilities resolve, regardless of who
controls the cards bearing the conflicting abilities.

If two or more constant abilities and/or lasting effects can be
applied simultaneously, they are. If two or more constant
abilities and/or lasting effects cannot be applied
simultaneously, the first player determines the order in which
they are applied.
Provinces, Province Cards
A player's provinces represent the lands under their domain. When
a province is attacked and turned faceup, the card represents what
the enemy finds or encounters upon first entering that province.
When playing the skirmish format, province tokens are used
instead of province cards. These tokens have no game text, no
element, and 3 defense strength. They are never considered to be
facedown or faceup, and are never revealed.
A face-down province card is considered to be in play only as a
face down province, and its faceup side is unable to engage
with the game state until the province is revealed.
A non-broken, faceup province card is considered to be in play,
and is engaged with the game state.
A broken province is considered to have a blank text box, and
its abilities cannot be used.
If a province has more than one card in it, those cards are
considered to all be in the same province. Characters and
events can be played, and holdings provide their bonuses. Do
not refill a province until it is empty.
Each player's non-stronghold provinces are placed in a linear
row in front of that player. Each of those provinces is adjacent
to the province immediately to its left and right. A player's
stronghold province is not adjacent to any other province.
Each province card has one or more elements associated with
it. A province with more than one element counts as a province
of each of its elements at all times and can be selected during
deck construction to fulfill the province slot of any of those
elements.
A fivefold tomoe symbol used in place of a
single element, such as on Toshi Ranbo
(Inheritance Cycle, 1), indicates that all five
elements are associated with that province.
During a conflict, a province is only considered to be an
"eligible" province to be attacked if it is controlled by the
defending player. The provinces of any non-defending players
are not eligible to be attacked. A player cannot attack their own
province.
Qualifiers
If card text includes a qualifier followed by multiple terms, the
qualifier applies to each item in the list, if it is applicable. For
example, in the phrase "each unique character and attachment,"
the word "unique" applies both to "character" and to
"attachment."
Rally
Rally is a keyword ability that appears on dynasty cards. When a
card with the rally keyword is revealed in a player's provinces, that
player fills the same province faceup. Both cards are in the province
together, and either can be played as an action during the dynasty
phase. Do not refill a province until it is empty.

20
When a province is filled or refilled faceup, or when a card is
added to a province faceup, that card is not revealed and the
rally keyword on it does not trigger.
A card with the Rally keyword does not count towards your
minimum deck size but still counts towards your maximum
deck size during deckbuilding. This means a player cannot
include more than 5 cards with the Rally keyword in their
deck, because a deck must contain at least 40 (or 30 in the
Skirmish format) non-Rally cards.
Reactions
A reaction is a triggered ability whose text is prefaced by a boldface
"Reaction:" precursor. Always resolve a triggering condition before
initiating any reactions to that triggering condition.
Unlike actions, which are resolved during action windows, a
reaction may be initiated only if its specified triggering condition
occurs, as described in the reaction ability's text.
After a triggering condition resolves, a reaction window for that
triggering condition opens.
Within the reaction window, the first player always has the first
opportunity to initiate an eligible reaction (to the triggering
condition that opened the window), or pass. Opportunities to
initiate an eligible reaction, or pass, continue to alternate between
the players until all players consecutively pass, at which point the
reaction window closes. Passing does not prevent a player from
initiating an eligible reaction later in that same reaction window.
Once a reaction window closes, further reactions to that specific
triggering condition cannot be initiated.
Unless otherwise noted by the ability, each reaction ability may
be initiated once each round. (This includes forced reactions.)
A reaction with a specified limit that enables it to be triggered
more than once per round may only be initiated once each time
its specified triggering condition occurs.
If multiple players can trigger a reaction ability, each may
do so to the same triggering condition.
Ready
A card that is in an upright state so that its controller can read its
text from left to right is considered ready.
The default state in which cards enter play is ready.
A ready card is bowed by rotating it 90 degrees to the side.
Refill a Province
If a player is instructed to refill a province, that player takes the top
card of his or her dynasty deck and places it facedown (without
looking at it) on the province.
After a card is removed from a province for any reason (and
after all reaction opportunities to that card leaving the
province are passed), a player automatically refills the province
from which the card was removed if that province is still empty
(i.e., if there is no dynasty card there).
If a player is instructed to refill a province faceup, the dynasty
card is placed in the province faceup rather than facedown.
RemovedfromGame

"Removed from the game" is an out-of-play state. A card that has
been removed from the game is set aside and has no further
interaction with the game in any manner for the duration of its
removal. If there is no specified duration, a card that has been
removed from the game is considered removed until the end of the
game.
Cards that have been removed from the game are faceup, open
information that is available to both players, unless otherwise
specified.
Replacement Effects
A replacement effect is an effect (usually an interrupt) that
replaces the resolution of a triggering condition with a different
means of resolving the same triggering condition, but in such a
manner that the triggering condition is still considered to occur for
the purposes of paying non-sacrifice costs. The word "instead" is
frequently indicative of such an effect. After all interrupts to the
triggering condition have resolved and it is time to resolve the
triggering condition itself, the replacement effect resolves instead.
If multiple replacement effects are initiated against the same
triggering condition, the most recently initiated replacement
effect is the one used for the resolution of the triggering
condition.
If the new resolution of a triggering condition caused by a
replacement effect would not change the game state, that
replacement effect cannot be initiated.
Related: Would
Resolve an Ability
Some abilities instruct a player to "resolve an ability" or "resolve
this ability twice." To resolve a triggered ability, resolve all text
after the bold timing word (action, reaction, or interrupt), paying
all ability costs, choosing any relevant targets, and resolving the
ability's effect.
When resolving a card's ability, that card is not being played,
and its fate cost (or other costs associated with playing the
card) are not paid.
Related: Initiating Abilities / Playing Cards
Restore a Province
If a player is instructed to restore a broken province, that province
is rotated 180 degrees and its ability text becomes active as the
province is no longer considered to be broken. It is not turned
facedown.
Restricted
Restricted is a keyword ability. A character may not have more than
two attachments with the restricted keyword attached to it at any
time.
If at any time a character has three or more restricted
attachments, that character's controller must immediately
choose and discard one of the restricted attachments on the
character as soon as the illegal game state occurs.
A player may choose to play a third restricted attachment onto
a character, but that character's controller must immediately
choose and discard one of its restricted attachments when the
new attachment enters play.

21

Reveal
When a player is instructed to reveal cards, that player is required
to show those cards to his or her opponent to that opponent's
satisfaction. If there is no specified duration for the reveal, the
cards remain revealed until they reach a new destination (as
specified by the ability), or through the ability's resolution.
While a card is revealed, it is still considered to be located in
the game area (such as a player's hand or deck) from which it
is revealed.
When a province card is revealed by a card effect, it remains
faceup until a card or game effect turns it facedown.
Rings
Rings, represented by double-sided tokens, are used to determine
the type and element of conflicts. Each ring exists in one or more
of three states, as follows:
Unclaimed - Each ring in the unclaimed ring pool is an unclaimed
ring, and is eligible to be selected by a player as a part of the
process of declaring a conflict.
Contested - While a conflict is resolving, the ring that has been
selected by the attacker when the conflict was declared is placed
on the attacked province. This ring is known as the contested ring.
Claimed - Each ring in a player's claimed ring pool is a claimed ring.
While performing a glory count, each player adds 1 to his or her
total for each ring in his or her claimed ring pool.
During the fate phase, place 1 fate on each unclaimed ring.
This step is skipped when playing the skirmish format.
When a ring becomes the contested ring in a conflict, move all
fate on that ring to the attacking player's fate pool.
When a ring is claimed, it is still considered to be contested
until all reactions to its claiming have resolved.
A card effect that refers to "the [ELEMENT] ring" refers to any
ring that has that element.
When a player claims a ring in the enlightenment format, that
ring is placed on one of that player's provinces. The ring is
considered to be "claimed on that province." Rings claimed on
a player's provinces do not return to the unclaimed ring pool
during the fate phase. They are still considered to be in that
player's claimed ring pool.
A player cannot have multiple rings of the same printed
element claimed on their provinces. If they would do so,
the duplicate ring is not claimed and is instead returned to
the attacking player's unclaimed ring pool (if contested) or
to the defending player's unclaimed ring pool (if claimed on
a broken province).
A player cannot claim a ring on their stronghold province
unless their stronghold province is eligible to be attacked
by their opponents.
If a player breaks an opponent's province during a conflict,
they claim each ring that was claimed on that province,
distributing those rings among their own provinces if able.
When a card effect would cause a ring to move from a

player's claimed ring pool to an unclaimed ring pool or vice-
versa, both pools must belong to the same player. During a

conflict, card effects can only switch the contested ring

with rings in the claimed or unclaimed ring pools of the
attacking player.
In the team conquest format, each team has a shared claimed
ring pool. For the purposes of card and game effects, a team's
claimed ring pool counts as the claimed ring pool of each player
on that team.
Related: Ring Effects
Ring Effects
Each time a player wins a conflict as the attacking player, he or she
may resolve the ring effect associated with the contested ring's
element. The ring effects are as follows:
Air: Either take 1 honor from your opponent, or gain 2 honor from
the general token pool.
Earth: Draw 1 card from your conflict deck and discard 1 random
card from your opponent's hand.
Fire: Choose a character in play and either honor or dishonor that
character.
Water: Either choose a character and ready it, or choose a
character with no fate on it and bow it.
Void: Choose a character and remove 1 fate from it.
Whenever a player resolves a ring effect for a ring that has
multiple elements, that player may choose among those
elements when the conflict's ring effect resolves.
When a player is instructed to resolve multiple ring effects,
they resolve each effect (or pass on that effect) in its entirety
before resolving the next ring effect.
When playing the skirmish format, the following three rings
have the following effects instead:
Air: Take 1 honor from your opponent.
Earth: Either draw 1 card from your conflict deck or discard
1 random card from your opponent's hand.
Water: Choose a character in any player's home area with
1 or fewer fate on it and either ready or bow it.
Role Cards
A role card is placed alongside a player's stronghold, and provides
specialized abilities and limitations for that player's deck. A player
may use a single role card in conjunction with his or her stronghold
while assembling a deck. The role card starts the game next to its
owner's stronghold and is revealed along with the stronghold
during setup.
Role cards are not used in the skirmish format.
Role cards are not considered in play. Their text affects the
game state from the out-of-play area while they are active
beside a player's stronghold.
Cards that are printed as the role cardtype cannot be removed
from the game by other card abilities.
Some cards have the text, "___ role only." This is a deckbuilding
restriction, and is not active during gameplay.
Running Out of Cards
If a player attempts to fill or refill one of their provinces or to draw
a card from their conflict deck and no cards remain in the deck, that

22
player loses 5 honor, then shuffles the corresponding discard pile
and places it facedown to form a new dynasty or conflict deck. That
player then continues to (re)fill the province or draw the conflict
card.
Sacrifice
When a player is instructed to sacrifice a card, that player must
select a card in play that he or she controls and that matches the
requirements of the sacrifice, and place it in his or her discard pile.
If the selected card does not leave play, the sacrifice is
considered to have been prevented.
Sacrificing a card does not satisfy other means (such as
"discard") of a card leaving play.
Search
When a player is instructed to search for a card, that player is
permitted to look at all of the cards in the searched area without
revealing those cards to his or her opponent.
If an effect searches an entire deck, the deck must be shuffled
to the satisfaction of the opponent upon completion of the
search.
A player is not obliged to find the object of a search effect, even
if the searched cards contain a card that meets the eligibility
requirements of the search.
If a search effect would add a card with specified
characteristics to a hidden game area, the player fulfilling the
search must reveal the card to his or her opponent to verify
that the card is eligible to be found by the search.
While a game area (or a part of a game area) is being searched,
the cards being searched are considered to still be in that game
area.

Select
Some abilities instruct a player to select among multiple options.
If a selection is required before the effect of the ability resolves
(i.e., before the dash), the selection is made during the same
timing step in which targets are chosen.
If a selection is indicated after the dash of an ability's text, that
selection is made during the resolution of the effect.
Unless otherwise indicated by the ability, the controller of the
ability is the player who makes the selection.
For all selections, an option that has the potential to change
the game state must be chosen, if able.
Related: Initiating Abilities
Self-referential Text
When a card's ability text refers to itself ("this character," "this
province," etc.), the text is referring to that copy only, and not to
other copies (by title) of the card.

Set
See "Modifiers".
Setup
To set up a game, perform the following steps in order:
1. Select decks. Each player selects a deck using the deckbuilding
rules. See "Deckbuilding".
2. Create token bank and unclaimed ring pool. Place all fate
tokens, honor tokens, status tokens, and the Imperial Favor in
a pile within reach of each player. This area is known as the
token bank. Place the rings near the token bank. This area is
known as the unclaimed ring pool.
In the enlightenment format, instead of placing five rings in
a single unclaimed ring pool, each player places five ring
tokens (one of each element) in their own personal
unclaimed ring pool.
3. Determine first player. Randomly select a player. That player
will be the first player. Place the first player token in front of
this player.
4. Shuffle dynasty and conflict decks. Each player shuffles both
their dynasty and conflict decks separately and presents them
to the opponent for additional shuffling and/or a final cut. Then
each player places their dynasty deck to the left of their play
area and their conflict deck to the right.
5. Place provinces and stronghold. In player order, each player
secretly selects one of their province cards, places it facedown
above their dynasty deck, and places their stronghold card on
top of it. If a player is using a role card, it is placed next to his
or her stronghold during this step. Each player then places their
other four provinces facedown between their dynasty and
conflict decks, in any order.
In the skirmish format, each player instead places three
province tokens between their dynasty and conflict decks.
6. Fill provinces. Each player places a card from the top of their

dynasty deck facedown onto each of their empty non-
stronghold provinces. In player order, each player looks at each

of his or her cards placed in this manner and has one
opportunity to mulligan any number of them.
Note: After this step, a player may not look at facedown
cards in his or her provinces.
7. Draw starting hand. Each player draws 4 cards from their
conflict deck. In player order, each player has one opportunity
to mulligan any number of these cards.
In the skirmish format, each player draws and mulligans to
3 cards instead of 4.
8. Gain starting honor. Each player gains honor tokens equal to
the honor value on their stronghold.
In the skirmish format, each player starts the game with 6
honor.
The game is now ready to begin.
Shadowlands
The Shadowlands is a special faction that functions in cooperative
and challenge play. It cannot be used in standard play and has a

23
unique set of rules documented in the Under Fu Leng's Shadow
rulebook, which can be found on www.L5R.com.
The Shadowlands faction is indicated by the following clan icon in
text ( ).

Shuffle
The word "shuffle" is used as a shorthand that instructs a player to
shuffle a deck that was just searched. When a player is instructed
to shuffle, only shuffle the deck or decks that were affected by the
ability.
Each time a deck is shuffled, it must be randomized to the
satisfaction of the opponent, and upon completion of the
shuffle presented to the opponent for additional shuffling
and/or a final cut.
Sincerity
Sincerity is a keyword ability. When a card with the sincerity
keyword leaves play, its controller draws 1 card.
The sincerity keyword resolves after the card leaves play,
before reactions to that card leaving play can be triggered.
Skill
A character's effectiveness in various endeavors is measured by its
skill. There are two types of skill in the game, military skill and
political skill.
Military skill ( ) is used to determine the victor during military
conflicts.
Political skill ( ) is used to determine the victor during political
conflicts.

Total attacking skill is the sum of each ready participating
character's skill (for the appropriate conflict type) on the
attacking player's side, plus any relevant modifiers.
Total defending skill is the sum of each ready participating
character's skill (for the appropriate conflict type) on the
defending player's side, plus any relevant modifiers.
A player is not able to win a conflict if that player has a total
attacking or defending skill of zero.
Status Token
A status token can be placed on a card to alter its status during a
game. These include honored status tokens and dishonored status
tokens. Each kind of status token has a different effect on the card
it is placed on.

Honored status tokens are used to indicate a character's
honored status. A character with an honored status token adds
its glory to each of its skills. That character's controller gains 1
honor when that character leaves play.
Dishonored status tokens are used to indicate a character's
dishonored status. A character with a dishonored status token
subtracts its glory from each of its skills. That character's
controller loses 1 honor when that character leaves play.
Tainted status tokens are used to indicate that a character or
province has been tainted by the Shadowlands. A character
with a tainted status token gets +2 and +2 , but its
controller must lose 1 honor when it is declared as an attacker
or defender in a conflict. A province with a tainted status token
gets +2 strength, but its controller must lose 1 honor when they
declare 1 or more defenders during conflicts at that province.
Dishonored status tokens can be placed on provinces by card
abilities. A province with a dishonored status token is treated
as if its printed text box were blank (except for Traits) while the
token is on that province.
A status token cannot be removed from a card unless it is a
character whose personal honor is changed (see Personal
Honor, Personal Dishonor on page 15) or a card effect
specifically moves or removes that status token.
If a card effect "moves" or "discards" an honored or
dishonored status token from a character, that character has
not been honored or dishonored for the purposes of card
abilities, even though it loses its honored/dishonored status.
See Personal Honor.
Stronghold
A player's stronghold is considered in play. A stronghold card
cannot leave play, move from the stronghold province, be turned
facedown, or change control.
Stronghold cards are not used in the skirmish format.
Support
The support keyword introduced in the Clan War expansion allows
multiple players to pay the fate cost of a card together. When a
player plays a card with the support keyword, another player may
choose to help pay the card's fate cost.
When a player is playing a card with the support keyword, they
may solicit the other players in the game to see if any player
wishes to contribute to paying the card's fate cost.
Alternatively, another player may offer to contribute fate.
The player who helps pay the cost of a card with the support
keyword is considered to be supporting the player who is
playing the card.
No other player is ever obligated to pay for a card with the
support keyword. The player playing a card with the support
keyword is never obligated to accept fate from another player
who wishes to support them.
If a player attempts to play a card with the support keyword
that they cannot fully pay for and no other player supports
them to help pay for the card, it remains unplayed in that
player's hand. They pay none of the card's costs.

24

Switch
Some abilities use the word "switch." In order to use such an ability,
switched items must exist on each side of the switch.
Take
If a player is instructed to take a token (such as honor or fate) from
another player, that element is removed from the other player's
token pool and added to the taking player's token pool.
The player taking the tokens is considered to be gaining the
tokens and the other player is considered to be losing the
tokens.

Tainted, Tainted Status Token
The tainted status token allows characters and provinces to
become tainted by the corrupting presence of Jigoku.
When a card ability or ring effect would taint a character, place a
tainted status token on it. A tainted character cannot be tainted
again.
Each character that is tainted gets +2 and +2 . As an
additional cost to declare a tainted character as an attacker or
defender in a conflict, its controller must lose 1 honor.
Each province that is tainted gets +2 strength. As an additional cost
to declare any number of defenders in a conflict against a tainted
province, its controller must lose 1 honor.
Once a card is tainted, that tainted status cannot be removed
unless a card ability discards (or moves) its status token. If a tainted
province is turned faceup or facedown, do not discard its tainted
status token.
A character's tainted status has no bearing on its personal honor,
and a tainted character can be honored or dishonored the same as
an untainted character.

Target
The word "choose" indicates that one or more targets must be
chosen in order for an ability to resolve. The player resolving the
effect must choose a game element (usually a card) that meets the
targeting requirements of the ability.
The controller of a targeting ability chooses all targets for the
effect unless otherwise specified by the card.
If an ability requires the choosing of one or more targets, and
there are not enough valid targets to meet all of its targeting
requirements, the ability cannot be initiated. This initiation
check is made at the same time the ability's play restrictions
are checked.
At the time targets are chosen, any currently valid targets are
eligible to be chosen. (This choice is not restricted only to
targets that were present during the initiation check.)
If multiple targets are required to be chosen by the same
player, these are chosen simultaneously.
Most card abilities that initiate a duel (see Duel Timing) use the
phrase "initiate a [type] duel." The characters chosen during

duel initiation are considered to be chosen as targets of the
ability that initiates the duel.
An ability that can choose "any number" of targets, or "up to
X" targets, can successfully resolve if zero such targets are
chosen, unless choosing zero such targets would cause the
resolution of the ability's effect to not change the game state
in any way.
Some abilities require the choice of a target that is not directly
affected by the ability — the target is instead chosen as a
reference point for the resolution of the ability. This is referred
to as a "referential target."
A card is not an eligible target for an ability if the resolution of
that ability's effect could not affect the target at all, unless it is
a referential target. (For example, a bowed character cannot be
chosen as the target for an ability that reads "Action: Choose a
character - bow that character.")
A card is only eligible to be chosen as a referential target for an
ability if that ability's effect (using the referential target) would
result in a change of game state. (For example, a character with
no attachments cannot be chosen as the target for an ability
that reads "Action: Choose a character — discard each
attachment on that character.")
The resolution of some effects (such as post-then effects, or
delayed effects) requires that targets are chosen after the
initiation of the effect. Such targets need not be verified when
checking play restrictions and determining whether or not the
entire ability may initiate. If there are no valid targets at the
time such targets would be chosen, that aspect of the effect
fails to resolve.
The word "To"
If the effect text of a card ability includes the word "to," then the
text that follows the word "to" can only be resolved if the
preceding text was successfully resolved in full.
If the pre-to aspect of an effect successfully resolves in full, the
post-to aspect of that effect resolves simultaneously with all
other effects of that card ability.
If the pre-to aspect of an effect does not successfully resolve in
full, the post-to aspect's resolution is canceled.
Token Pool, General Token Pool
The token pool (also referred to as the general token pool) is
created during setup and contains all of the tokens and counters
not currently controlled by any player.
When a player gains fate or honor, that fate or honor is taken
from the token pool and added to that player's fate or honor
pool. When a player spends or loses fate or honor, those tokens
are returned to the token pool.
When a card with any tokens or counters on it leaves play,
those tokens and counters are returned to the token pool.
Tokens, Running Out of
There is no limit to the number of fate, honor, and personal status
tokens which can be in the game area at a given time. If players run
out of the provided tokens, other tokens, counters, or coins may
be used to track the game state.

Traits
Most cards have one or more traits listed at the top of the text box
and printed in Bold Italics.
Traits have no inherent effect on the game. Instead, some card
abilities reference cards that possess specific traits.
Treaties
During the course of an enlightenment format game, players may
find themselves in situations where a mutually beneficial
agreement called a treaty can be made. In addition to setting up
the terms of the treaty, both players agree on value to stake on the
treaty (by default, an amount of honor). If either player breaks
their part of a treaty, that player must suffer consequences based
on the value staked on the treaty.
When two players are setting up a treaty, each of the following
parameters must be specified. Those players may discuss and
determine these parameters in any order, but each parameter
must be agreed upon by both involved players before a treaty can
be finalized. The parameters are as follows:
What is Being Promised by Each Player: When making a promise
for a treaty, a player offers something they are going to do, or not
do, during the course of the game. This promise must be an action
or a decision that a player can take and cannot include an exchange
of game components (honor, fate, cards, or claimed rings).
Duration: When a treaty is established, both involved players must
agree to a duration for how long the treaty is going to last. This
duration can be of any length, from "immediate" to "the remainder
of the game." Once a treaty's duration has ended it either is
dissolved (if both players have kept their promises), or it is broken
(if one player did not do what they promised in the specified
timeframe), causing the player that broke the treaty to suffer the
consequences.
Value: Both involved players must agree upon value to stake on the
treaty (between 1 and 5). If during the course of play, the treaty
between the two players is broken by either player, the player that
broke the treaty suffers a penalty based on the value staked on the
treaty. By default, this comes in the form of losing that amount of
honor, though it may be defined by a treaty card.
After a treaty has been broken, the players are no longer bound
by the promises they made when establishing the treaty.
Each player can form a treaty with any number of other
players, but each pair of players may only have one treaty
active between them at any given time. If a treaty between two
players has dissolved, or been broken, a new treaty may be
formed between those players.
TreatyCards
Treaty cards are included in the Clan War expansion and can be
used to increase variety when playing the enlightenment format.
To use these cards, shuffle them into a treaty deck at the start of
the game and set it within reach of all players. These replace the
default method of staking honor on treaties.
Whenever two players agree on a treaty, they place the top card of
the treaty deck facedown between them without looking at it and
mark the value staked on the treaty. When a player breaks that
treaty, they reveal the card and resolve its text. Note that any
treaty card that refers to "the player who did not break this treaty"
refers only to the single other player with whom the treaty was
made.

After a treaty is broken (and its effects resolved) or fulfilled (and its
effects unrevealed), put that treaty card on the bottom of the
treaty deck.
Triggered Abilities
A boldface timing command followed by a colon indicates that an
ability is a triggered ability. Triggered abilities fall into one of the
following types: actions, interrupts, and reactions. Some interrupt
and reaction abilities are also forced.
Unless the timing command is prefaced by the word "Forced,"
all triggered abilities are optional. They can be triggered (or
not) by their controller at the ability's appropriate timing point.
Forced triggered abilities are triggered automatically by the
game at the ability's appropriate timing point.
Any targets that must be chosen in the resolution of a
card's "Forced" ability are chosen by the controller of that
card.
Unless otherwise specified by the ability itself, each triggered
ability may be triggered once per round. This limit is player
specific.
Triggered abilities are written in a "triggering condition
(and/or) cost (and/or) targeting requirements - effect"
template. Ability text before the dash consists of triggering
conditions (and/or) costs (and/or) targeting requirements.
Ability text after the dash consists of effects. and may
sometimes include targeting requirements that come into play
as the effect is being resolved.
If a triggered ability has no dash, the ability has no pre-dash
content, and the entirety of the ability is considered an effect.
A triggered ability can only be initiated if its effect has the
potential to change the game state on its own. This potential is
assessed without taking into account the consequences of the
cost payment or the consequences of any other ability
interactions.
A triggered ability can only be initiated if its cost (after
modifiers) has the potential to be paid in full.
Related: Ability, Action, Cost, Effect, Interrupts, Limits of Triggered
Abilities, Reactions, Target
Triggering Condition
A triggering condition is a condition which dictates when an ability
can be triggered. On card abilities, the triggering condition is the
element of the ability that references such a condition, which most
often comes in the form of a specific occurrence that takes place
during the game. This indicates the timing point at which the ability
may be used. The description of an ability's triggering condition
often follows the word "when" (for interrupt abilities) or the word
"after" (for reaction abilities), or the word "if" (for action abilities.
If a single occurrence creates multiple triggering conditions for
reactions or interrupts (such as a single Earth ring effect causing a
player to draw a card and another player to discard a card), those
triggering conditions are handled in shared interrupt/reaction
windows, in which abilities that refer to any of the triggering
conditions created by that occurrence may be used in any order.
The following is a sequence of possible interrupt and reaction
opportunities that exists around each triggering condition that may
arise in a game:
1. The triggering condition becomes imminent. (Meaning that if it
is not canceled, changed, or otherwise preempted by interrupt

26
abilities, the triggering condition is the next thing that will
occur in the game.)
2. Interrupt abilities that reference when the imminent triggering
condition "would" occur may be used. (Note: For effects, a
"cancel" interrupt may prevent the effect from initiating, and
the initiation of the effect is a separate triggering condition
that precedes the effect's resolution. "Cancel" interrupts are
the only type that will reference the initiation of an effect.) If
the imminent triggering condition is canceled, none of the
subsequent steps in this sequence occur. If the triggering
condition is changed, the original condition is no longer
imminent, but the new triggering condition is now imminent.
3. Forced interrupts that reference the imminent triggering
condition must resolve, in the order determined by the first
player. The standard interrupt window to the imminent
triggering condition opens. It closes after all players
consecutively pass.
4. The triggering condition itself occurs.
5. Forced reactions that reference the triggering condition must
resolve, in the order determined by the first player.
6. The reaction window to the triggering condition opens. It
closes after all players consecutively pass.
Unique Cards
A card with the symbol in front of its title is a unique card. Each
player may only have a maximum of one instance of each unique
card, by title, in play.
A player cannot take control of or bring into play a unique card
if he or she already controls or owns another in-play card with
the same title or printed title.
A player cannot bring into play a unique card owned by his or
her opponent if that opponent controls an in-play card with the
same title or printed title.
As a player action during the dynasty phase, a player may
discard a copy (by title) of a unique character from his or her
hand or provinces to place 1 fate on an in-play copy of that
unique character he or she controls.
In team games, the rules listed above apply to a team instead
of a player (players on the same team may only have a
maximum of one instance of each unique card, by title, in play
at any time).
While two or more players on a team control more than one
copy of a unique stronghold, province card, or holding, treat
each copy of that card as if its printed text box were blank and
as if it had a strength or bonus strength of 0.
Related: Duplicates
Unopposed, Unopposed Conflict
A conflict is unopposed if the attacking player wins the conflict and
the defending player controls no defending characters at the time
the conflict winner is determined.
Each time the defending player loses an unopposed conflict in
the stronghold format, that player loses 1 honor. The lost
honor is returned to the general token pool. This occurs during
framework step 3.2.4.
In the team conquest format, a conflict is only considered
unopposed if no player on the defending team controls any

defending characters at the time the attacking team wins the
conflict. If that is the case, each player on the defending team
loses 1 honor.
Winning a Conflict
Each conflict is won by the player who counts the highest total skill
applicable for that conflict type for his or her side when the conflict
result is determined.
A player's total skill is the sum of the skill matching the conflict
type of each ready participating character on his or her side of
the conflict, along with any other modifiers that are affecting
the amount of skill the player counts for the conflict.
A player must count at least 1 total skill and there must be at
least one participating character on his or her side in order to
win a conflict.
If the total skill counted on each side is tied at a value of 1 or
greater (and the attacking player controls at least one
participating character), the attacking player wins the conflict.
If neither player can meet the requirements of winning a
conflict, neither player wins (or loses) that conflict. When this
occurs, return the contested ring to the unclaimed ring pool.
Some card abilities reference a character "winning" a conflict.
In order for a character to be considered to have "won" a
conflict, that character must be participating in the conflict on
the winning side at the time the ability resolves.
Some card abilities reference a character "losing" a conflict. In
order for a character to be considered to have "lost" a conflict,
that character must be participating in the conflict on the losing
side at the time the ability resolves.
In the team conquest format, players on a team win or lose the
conflict as a team, regardless of who controls participating
characters. Any card abilities that trigger when a player wins
(or loses) a conflict can be triggered if that player wins (or loses)
a conflict.
Winning the Game
In each format there are three primary paths to victory in the
game. The game ends immediately if a player meets one (or more)
of these victory conditions.
If all but a single player has been eliminated from the game,
that player is the game's winner.
Some card abilities can introduce additional victory conditions
to the game. Such a condition immediately ends the game if it
is met.
If two or more players would reach a victory condition
simultaneously, the first player wins the game if they have
reached a victory condition. If they have not, the player closes
to the first player's left who has reached a victory condition
wins the game.
Stronghold format victory conditions:
If a player's stronghold province is broken, that player is
eliminated from the game.
The first player to meet the condition of having 25 or more
honor in their honor pool wins the game.
The first player to have 0 honor in their honor pool is
eliminated from the game.

27

Skirmish format victory conditions:
If all three of a player's province are broken, that player is
eliminated from the game.
The first player to meet the condition of having 12 or more
honor in their honor pool wins the game.
When a player has 0 honor in their honor pool, they are
eliminated from the game.
Enlightenment format victory conditions:
The first player to collect all five elemental rings on their
provinces wins the game.
The first player to meet the condition of having 25 or more
honor in their honor pool wins the game.
If a player's stronghold province is broken, or if a player has
0 honor in their honor pool, that player is eliminated from
the game.
Team conquest format victory conditions:
If the stronghold province of each member of a single team
is broken, that team loses the game and the opposing team
wins the game.
The first team to meet the condition of having 50 or more
honor in their honor pool wins the game.
The word "Would"
The word "would" is used to define the triggering condition of
some interrupt abilities, and establishes a higher priority for those
abilities than interrupts to the same triggering condition that lack
the word "would."
All "would be X" interrupts are eligible to be used before any "is X"
interrupts. This means that an interrupt with the word "would"
(such as "when a character would leave play") has timing priority
over an interrupt without the word "would" that references that
same occurrence (such as "when a character leaves play").
If an interrupt to a triggering condition that would occur
changes the nature of that which is about to occur, no further
interrupts to the original triggering condition may be used, as
that triggering condition is no longer imminent.
The letter "X"
Unless specified by a card ability or granted player choice, the
letter X is always equal to 0.
For costs involving the letter X, the value of X is defined by card
ability or player choice, after which the amount paid may be
modified by effects without altering the value of X.

Appendix I: Timing and

Gameplay

This section provides a detailed overview of the phases and
framework steps of an entire game round. The "Phase Sequence
Timing Chart" depicts each framework step and action window that
occurs throughout a game round. The "Framework Details" section
explains how to handle each framework step presented on the
game's flow chart, in the order that the frameworks steps occur
throughout the round.
Framework Steps
Numbered (or lettered) items presented in the darker grey boxes
are known as framework steps. Framework steps are mandatory
occurrences dictated by the structure of the game. Purple windows
are special framework steps that indicate the possibility of the
game returning to an earlier framework step in the chart. These
repetitive sequences can end in various ways, such as when all
players have performed the steps in a sequence, or when a player
makes a specific decision. Each purple window explains when and
how the game either loops back or progresses to a later framework
step.
Action Windows
An action ability may only be triggered during an action window.
Action windows are presented in lighter orange boxes on the chart.
When most action windows open, the player or team with the first
player token has the first opportunity to initiate an action, or pass.
The one exception to this is the action window during the conflict
phase, in which the defending player (or team) has the first
opportunity to initiate an action, or pass. Opportunities to initiate
actions alternate between the players in player order until all
players consecutively pass, at which point the action window
closes and the game advances to the next step on the timing chart.
Note that if a player passes their opportunity to act, but any other
opponent does not consecutively pass in sequence, the original
player may still take an action when the alternation of action
opportunities returns to the player who had passed.
Resolve each action completely before the next action
opportunity.
During each action window, players are permitted to play character
and attachment cards from hand.
Reactions and Interrupts
A reaction ability to a framework effect may be initiated
immediately after the completion of any framework step.
An interrupt ability to a framework effect may be initiated during
the resolution of that step, interrupting the process of that step.

Framework Details

Each of the following entries corresponds to the framework step of
the same number on the Phase Sequence Timing Chart.
1. Dynasty Phase
1.1. Dynasty phase begins
This step formalizes the beginning of the dynasty phase. As this is
the first framework step of the round, it also formalizes the
beginning of a new game round.
The beginning of a phase is an important game milestone that may
be referenced in card text, either as a point at which an ability may
or must resolve, or as a point at which a lasting effect or constant
ability begins or expires.
1.2. Reveal facedown dynasty cards
In player order, each player turns each facedown dynasty card in
each of their provinces faceup. A player's cards are turned over one
at a time, from the player's leftmost province to their rightmost
province. If there are any facedown cards in a player's stronghold
province, those cards are turned faceup first.
1.3. Collect fate
In player order, each player collects fate equal to the fate value on
his or her stronghold card, incorporating all active fate modifiers.
This fate is taken from the general token pool and added to the
player's fate pool.
In the enlightenment format, the first player collects 1
additional fate during the dynasty phase.
1.4. Play cards from provinces
This is a special action window in which the opportunity to act
alternates back and forth between the players, in player order.
With his or her opportunity to act, a player may do one of the
following:
Play one card from their provinces or hand.
Trigger an eligible action ability.
Discard a duplicate of a character from his or her hand or from
one of his or her provinces to place 1 fate on a copy of that
character under his or her control.
Pass.
To play a character from a province, a player removes a number of
fate equal to the character's fate cost from his or her fate pool, and
returns that fate to the general token pool. The character enters
play and is placed in the player's home area. The player then has
the option to place any number of additional fate from his or her
fate pool onto that character. Once this option to place additional
fate has been completed or passed, the province from which the
character was played is refilled facedown from the dynasty deck.
When a player passes, that player relinquishes all further
opportunities to act during this phase. (A player who has passed
may still trigger interrupts and reactions to any eligible
occurrence.) The player to pass first gains 1 fate from the general
token pool and adds it to his or her fate pool. After one player has
passed, the other player may continue to use action opportunities

until he or she also passes. Once both players have passed, this
step is complete.
1.5. Dynasty phase ends
This step formalizes the end of the dynasty phase.
The end of a phase is an important game milestone that may be
referenced in card text, either as a point at which an ability may or
must resolve, or as a point at which a lasting effect or constant
ability expires or begins.
2. Draw Phase
2.1. Draw phase begins
This step formalizes the beginning of the draw phase.
2.2. Honor bid
Each player secretly selects a number from 1 to 5 on his or her
honor dial as his or her honor bid for this round. Once both players
have confirmed that they are ready, proceed to the next step.
In the skirmish format, players cannot select a number higher
than 3 on their honor dial.
2.3. Reveal honor dials
The players simultaneously reveal their bids.
Once a player reveals an honor bid, the dial is placed next to the
player's stronghold or conflict deck and remains as a reference
point until the next honor bid occurs.
2.4. Transfer honor
The player with the higher honor bid must give an amount of honor
to the player with the lower honor bid that is equal to the
difference between the two bids. If the bids are equal, no honor is
transferred during this step.
In the enlightenment format, all three players compare their
honor bids with one another for the purposes of transferring
honor.
If each player selects a different number on their honor
dial, the player who selects the highest number gives honor
to the player who selects the lowest number. The amount
of honor given is equal to the difference between the
numbers those two players select. The player whose
number is in between the other two does not gain or lose
honor.
If two players select the same number and the remaining
player selects a number that is higher than that selected by
their two opponents, the player that selected the higher
number gives honor to both opponents. The amount of
honor given is equal to the difference between the two
numbers selected, divided as evenly as possible between
the two players that selected the same number. If any
honor remains to be given after dividing the honor as
evenly as possible, the player giving the honor selects
which opponent the remaining honor is given to.
If two players select the same number and the remaining
player selects a number that is lower than that selected by
their two opponents, the player that selected the lower
number takes honor from both opponents. The total
amount of honor taken is equal to the difference between
the two numbers selected, divided as evenly as possible
between the two players that selected the same number.

31
If any honor remains to be taken after dividing it as evenly
as possible, the player receiving the honor selects which
opponent to take the remaining honor from.
In the team conquest format, each player only compares their
honor bid with that of the opponent sitting across from them
for the purposes of transferring honor.
2.5. Draw cards
Each player simultaneously draws a number of cards from their
conflict deck equal to their honor bid.
2.6. Draw phase ends
This step formalizes the end of the draw phase.
3. Conflict Phase
3.1. Conflict phase begins
This step formalizes the beginning of the conflict phase.
3.2. Declare conflict
(Shares 3.2 with conflict resolution chart.)
During the conflict phase, each player is granted one or more
opportunities to declare a conflict. These conflict opportunities
alternate between players with remaining conflict opportunities in
player order until each player has declared a conflict or passed on
each of their conflict opportunities. In the team conquest format,
conflict opportunities are given to each team instead of each
player.
In the stronghold, enlightenment, and team conquest formats,
each player (or team) is granted one opportunity to declare a
military conflict and one opportunity to declare a political conflict.
A player's military and political conflicts may be declared in either
order during the round. In the skirmish format, each player is
granted one opportunity to declare a conflict of either type.
When a player has an opportunity to declare a conflict, that player
may:
Declare a military conflict.
Declare a political conflict.
Pass.
If a conflict opportunity is passed, the player forfeits his or her right
to use that opportunity this phase.
In order to declare a conflict, the attacking player must:
Declare the type and element of the conflict to be initiated.
This is indicated by selecting a ring from the unclaimed ring
pool (this ring is known as the contested ring, and defines the
element of the conflict), and placing it on an opponent's
eligible unbroken province (this indicates which province is
being attacked) with either the military side or the political side
faceup (the faceup side of the contested ring defines the type
of the conflict).
A conflict cannot be declared against a player's stronghold
province in the stronghold or enlightenment formats unless at
least three of that player's non-stronghold provinces are broken. A
conflict cannot be declared against a player's stronghold province
in the team conquest format unless that player's team controls at

least 3 broken provinces and at least one of that player's non-
stronghold provinces is broken.

If a player selects an unclaimed ring with fate on it to become the
contested ring, that fate is moved from the ring to the attacking
player's fate pool.
In the enlightenment format, a player can only declare a
conflict using a ring in their personal unclaimed ring pool or
the common unclaimed ring pool.
Declare which ready characters (under his or her control) are
being committed as attackers. The attacking player may
declare any number of eligible characters under his or her
control as attackers. Slide these characters toward the center
of the play area, away from the attacking player's home area.
At least one character must be declared as an attacker at this
time in order to initiate a conflict. If any of the attackers have
the covert keyword, the targets for covert are chosen at this
time.
In the team conquest format, each player on the attacking
team may declare attackers in the same conflict, and those
characters participate on the same side together.
Each of the above items are considered to be performed
simultaneously. If any of the above cannot be completed, the
conflict cannot be initiated.
If the province being attacked is facedown, turn it faceup as soon
as a conflict is successfully declared against it. This occurs before
any reactions to the process of conflict declaration may be
triggered.
Once a conflict has been declared, resolve that conflict before the
next conflict is declared.
If no player has a conflict opportunity remaining when this step is
reached, advance to step 3.4.
3.2.1. Declare defenders
The defending player declares which - if any - ready characters
(under his or her control) are being committed as defenders. The
defending player may declare any number of eligible characters
under his or her control as defenders. Slide these characters
toward the center of the play area, away from the defending
player's home area. Declaring "no defenders" is also an option.
In the team conquest format, the controller of the attacked
province may declare one or more defenders if they choose,
and each other player on their team may declare up to one one
defender. Those characters participate on the same side
together.
3.2.2. Conflict action window
This is a special action window in which the defending player
(rather than the first player) has the first action opportunity. These
opportunities then alternate between the players until both
players consecutively pass.
With an action opportunity, a player may:
Activate an eligible action ability on a card he or she controls.
Play an event card with an action trigger from his or her hand.
Play an attachment card from hand, and attach it to any eligible
character in play.
Play a character from hand, into the conflict, participating on
that player's side. (Additional fate from the player's fate pool
may be placed on the character at this time.)
Play a character from hand into his or her home area.
(Additional fate from the player's fate pool may be placed on
the character at this time.)

32

Pass.
After using an action opportunity, a player must announce the total
relevant skill present on both sides of the conflict that would be
counted if the conflict were to resolve with no further actions.
Once both players consecutively pass their action opportunities,
proceed to the next step.
3.2.3. Compare skill values and determine result
The conflict type indicates which skill value is used to resolve the
conflict. During a military conflict use military skill. During a
political conflict use political skill.
First, determine the attacking player's total skill in the conflict by
adding together the skill (that matches the conflict type) of each
ready attacking character and factor in all active modifiers. Then
determine the defending player's total skill in the conflict by adding
together the skill (that matches the conflict type) of each ready
defending character and factor in all active modifiers.
The player whose side has the higher total skill wins the conflict. In
order to win a conflict, a player must count a total skill of 1 or
higher. In the case of a tie, the conflict is won by the attacking
player. If both players count 0 skill, the conflict resolves with no
winner, and the ring is returned to the pool of unclaimed rings.
In the team conquest format, players win or lose the conflict as
a team, regardless of who controls participating characters.
Any card abilities that trigger when a player wins a conflict can
be triggered if that player's team wins a conflict (the same is
true for losing a conflict), as each player on that team counts
as having won the conflict.
3.2.4. Apply unopposed
If the attacking player won the conflict and the defending player
controls no defending characters (in step 3.2.3), the conflict is
considered "unopposed." If playing the stronghold or team
conquest format, the defending player loses 1 honor and returns it
to the general token pool.
If the defending player or no player won the conflict, nothing
happens during this step.
3.2.5. Break province
If the attacking player won the conflict by an amount equal to or
greater than the strength of the attacked province (in step 3.2.3),
the province is broken. Rotate the province 180 degrees or discard
the province token to indicate this.
If the attacking player wins a conflict and breaks a province, they
may immediately discard any dynasty cards on that province. If the
province becomes empty this way, the province is refilled
facedown as normal.
If the defending player or no player won the conflict, nothing
happens during this step.
3.2.6. Resolve ring effects
If the attacking player won the conflict (in step 3.2.3), that player
may resolve the ring effect of the contested ring. The ring effects
are as follows:
Air: Either take 1 honor from your opponent, or gain 2 honor from
the general token pool.
Earth: Draw 1 card from your conflict deck and discard 1 random
card from your opponent's hand.
Fire: Choose a character in play and either honor or dishonor that
character.

Water: Either choose a character and ready it, or choose a
character with no fate on it and bow it.
Void: Choose a character and removes 1 fate from it.
If the defending player or no player won the conflict, nothing
happens during this step.
When playing the skirmish format, the following three rings
have the following effects instead:
Air: Take 1 honor from your opponent.
Earth: Either draw 1 card from your conflict deck or discard
1 random card from your opponent's hand.
Water: Choose a character in any player's home area with
1 or fewer fate on it and either ready or bow it.
In the team conquest format, the Air and Earth ring effects may
only be resolved against the opponent whose province is being
attacked, and only a single player on the attacking team may
receive the ring's effect.
3.2.7. Claim ring
The player who won the conflict (in step 3.2.3) claims the contested
ring and adds it to his or her claimed ring pool.
In the enlightenment format, the attacking player claims the
ring on one of their eligible provinces if they win the conflict.
The defending player does not claim the ring if they win the
conflict, and it is returned to the attacking player's personal
unclaimed ring pool.
If no player won the conflict (in step 3.2.3), the ring is returned to
the unclaimed ring pool.
The ring continues to define the conflict type and element(s) until
the end of the conflict even after it ceases to be contested.
3.2.8. Return home
Simultaneously bow each ready participating character in the
conflict. Return each participating character to its controller's
home area. These characters are no longer participating in the
conflict.
3.3. Conflict ends / Conflict was passed
This step formalizes the end of a conflict, or that a conflict
opportunity has been passed. Return to the action window
following step 3.1.
3.4. Determine Imperial Favor
This step marks the beginning of the contest for the Imperial Favor.
3.4.1. Glory count
Each player counts the total glory value of all ready characters he
or she controls, factors in all active modifiers, and adds 1 to this
count for each ring in his or her claimed ring pool.
The players then compare their totals. The player with the higher
total wins the glory count. If the totals are tied, neither player wins
the glory count.
In the team conquest format, each team adds together the
total glory on ready characters they control and adds one for
each ring claimed by their team. This total is compared to that
of the opposing team, and one of the two teams wins the glory
count if the totals are not tied.

33

3.4.2. Claim Imperial favor
The player who won the glory count (in step 3.4.1) claims the
Imperial Favor by taking the Imperial Favor card, setting it to its
military side or to its political side, and placing it next to his or her
stronghold. That player is said to "have the Imperial Favor," and the
card may influence the following game round. If a player who
already has the Imperial Favor claims it again, the player may set it
to either side.
If players have the same total, the Imperial Favor remains in its
current state (either unclaimed or under the possession of the
player who currently has it, remaining set on its current side).
This step also marks the end of the contest for the Imperial Favor.
3.5. Conflict phase ends
This step formalizes the end of the conflict phase.
4. Fate Phase
4.1. Fate phase begins
This step formalizes the beginning of the fate phase.
4.2. Discard characters with no fate
In player order, each player discards each character he or she
controls with no fate on it. These characters are discarded one at a
time, in the order of the discarding player's choosing. Characters
are only discarded in this way if they had no fate on them during
the initation of this step and no fate when they would be discarded.
4.3. Remove fate from characters
Simultaneously remove 1 fate from each character in play.
4.4. Place fate on unclaimed rings
Simultaneously place 1 fate from the general token pool on each
unclaimed ring.
• This framework step is skipped when playing the skirmish
format.
• In the enlightenment format, instead of placing 1 fate on
each unclaimed ring, each player chooses 1 ring in an
opponent's unclaimed ring pool and places 1 fate from
the general token pool on that ring.
4.5. Ready cards
Simultaneously ready each bowed card in play.
4.6. Discard from provinces
In player order, each player must discard each faceup card from
each his or her broken provinces, and also has the opportunity to
choose and discard any number of faceup dynasty cards from his
or her unbroken provinces.
Each province that becomes empty in this way is refilled with a
facedown card from the top of its owner's dynasty deck.
• In the skirmish format, players do not discard faceup
cards in broken provinces unless they choose to do so.
4.7. Return rings
Simultaneously return each claimed ring to the unclaimed ring
pool.

This framework step is skipped when playing the
enlightenment format.
4.8. Pass first player token
The player with the first player token passes it to the opponent to
their left. That player becomes the first player.
4.9. Fate phase ends
This step formalizes the end of the fate phase.
As the fate phase is the final phase in the round, this step also
formalizes the end of the round. Any active "until the end of the
round" lasting effects expire at this time.
After this step is complete, play proceeds to the beginning of the
dynasty phase of the next game round.
Duel Timing
D.1 Initiate a duel.
D.2 Establish the challenge.
D.3 Duel honor bid.
D.4 Reveal honor dials.
D.5 Transfer honor.
D.6 Calculate dueling statistic.
D.7 Calculate duel total and determine result.
D.8 Apply duel results.
D.9 Duel ends.
D.1. Initiate a duel
When a card ability initiates a duel, part of the cost of that ability
may use the phrase, "initiate a [type] duel." This opens the duel
timing window.
To initiate a duel, the player resolving the card ability must choose
two characters to duel against each other: one they control and
one controlled by an opponent. The following parameters exist on
which characters can be chosen for the duel:
One character must be controlled by the player whose card
ability initiates the duel, and one character must be controlled
by an opponent of that player.
If a duel is initiated during a conflict, both characters chosen
must be participating.
If a duel is initiated by an ability on a character card, that
character is automatically involved in the duel. Some abilities
use the phrase "this character initiates" as a reminder of this.
That character is not considered to be chosen as a target of the
duel, as it is already involved.
During a conflict, a duel can only be initiated by an ability
on a character card if that character is participating in the
conflict.
If this process is completed, a duel has been initiated. Otherwise,
the duel fails to initiate and cannot resolve.

34

Resolve the duel
A duel is resolved during the successful resolution of any triggered
ability that instructs players to "resolve the duel," or that their
"character challenges the opponent's character to a [type] duel."
To resolve a duel, perform the following steps:
D.2. Establish the challenge
The process of initiating the duel (in step D.1) will have identified
the two characters that are involved in the duel, as well as the kind
of duel that will take place. This statistic ( skill, skill, or glory)
will be used to determine the results of the duel.
D.3. Duel honor bid
Each player secretly selects a number from 1 to 5 on his or her
honor dial as his or her honor bid for this duel. Once both players
have confirmed that they are ready, proceed to the next step.
In the skirmish format, players cannot select a number higher
than 3 on their honor dial.
D.4. Reveal honor dials
The players simultaneously reveal their bids.
Once a player reveals an honor bid, the dial is placed next to the
player's stronghold or conflict deck and remains as a reference
point until the next honor bid occurs.
D.5. Transfer honor
The player with the higher honor bid must give an amount of honor
to the player with the lower honor bid that is equal to the
difference between the two bids. If the bids are equal, no honor is
transferred during this step.
D.6. Calculate dueling statistic
The process of initiating the duel (in step D.1) will have established
which statistic ( skill, skill, or glory) is being used to
determine the results of the duel. Each player calculates the
current value of that statistic for their character involved in the
duel. Any skill modifiers that were active at the time the duel was
initiated are still applicable during the duel.
If multiple characters are involved in the duel on the same side,
add their dueling statistics together. The value calculated in
this step is treated as the skill value of a single character for the
purposes of determining duel results. Those characters win or
lose the duel together
D.7. Add honor bid, compare values, and determine result
Each player calculates their duel total and compares it with that of
their opponent to determine the results.
In the stronghold, enlightenment, and team conquest formats,
each player adds their duel honor bid to the statistic value they
calculated in step D.6 to determine their duel total.
In the skirmish format, the player with the higher dueling statistic
value calculated in step D.6 adds 1 to their honor bid to determine
their duel total. The other player's duel total is equal to their honor
bid and is not increased by the dueling statistic.
The character whose controller has the higher duel total is the
duel's winner.
The character whose controller has the lower duel total is the
duel's loser.

If the duel totals are the same, neither character is the duel's
winner and neither character is the duel's loser.
D.8. Apply duel results
The ability that initiated the duel (in step D.1) specified the
consequences of this duel for the winning and/or losing characters,
or for the player(s) controlling those characters. Apply those
consequences during this step.
D.9. Duel ends
This step formalizes the end of the duel. Return to the action
window in which the duel was initiated, with the next player in the
sequence of actions having the next opportunity to act.
NOTE: There are no action windows during a duel, so players
are not able to initiate actions or play characters and
attachments from their hands during the resolution of a duel.
Applicable interrupt and/or reaction abilities may be triggered
during a duel.

Appendix III: Card
Clarifications

This section provides answers to a number of common questions
that are asked about cards in the game. These answers are
organized by the expansion and collector number of the card
whose rules interaction has raised the question.
Core Set
Shameful Display (24)
Neither the honoring nor the dishonoring aspect of Shameful
Display's ability is dependent upon the other. Additionally,
targets for the ability may be chosen even if one or both of
those characters could be either honored or dishonored (you
do not need to select which character is receiving which aspect
when choosing targets). If Shameful Display honors/dishonors
one character and fails to honor/dishonor the other, it has still
resolved successfully, even though it failed to affect one of the
chosen characters. That character is still a valid target for the
ability as it could have been affected by either aspect at the
time it was chosen.
Savvy Politician (45)
Savvy Politician's ability does not trigger if an honored status
token is moved to it by a card ability. It only triggers if an effect
"honors" it.
Young Rumormonger (101)
Young Rumormonger's ability does not trigger if an honored or
dishonored status token is moved to a character by a card
ability. It only triggers if an effect "honors" or "dishonors" a
character.
Reprieve (132)
Reprieve's effect can prevent a character from being sacrificed.
If that occurs during the payment of a cost, then that cost
is not considered to have been paid as the sacrifice was
prevented (see page 5). If the sacrifice while paying an
event's cost is prevented, the effects do not initiate, and
that event remains unplayed in its owner's hand.
If that occurs during the resolution of an effect, then
nothing is dependent upon whether or not the sacrifice
resolved successfully. In the same way that an event whose
effects were canceled by Voice of Honor (Core, 145) is still
considered to have been played, a card like Way of the Crab
(Core, 137) is still considered to have been played even if
its effects are prevented by Reprieve.
Watch Commander (133)
If a player plays a card whose effects result in Watch
Commander being discarded, its ability cannot be triggered as
it is no longer in play.
If a player plays a card whose effects result in the attached
character no longer participating in the conflict, Watch
Commander's ability cannot be triggered as the triggering
condition is no longer met.

Steward of Law (139)
If a character "cannot receive dishonored status tokens," then
those tokens cannot be placed on or moved to that character.
That character cannot be dishonored if it is ordinary. (See page
32.)
Above Question (141)
If Above Question is played on an opponent's character, that
opponent cannot choose the attached character as a target for
their own events.
If the attached character is the only participating character
controlled by that opponent, Court Games' honoring effect
(Core, 206) cannot be selected, as the attached character
cannot be chosen as a target.
Way of the Lion (167)
When you play two copies of Way of the Lion on the same
character during a conflict, that character's skill will be
doubled twice (to now be quadruple the original skill value).
The new base skill value continues to double if additional
copies are played.
Display of Power (179)
When Display of Power is played, it produces a delayed effect
that cancels the normal effects of ring resolution during step
3.2.6 "Resolve Ring Effects" and replaces it with "resolve the
ring effect as if you had won the conflict as the attacking
player." Losing honor for unopposed and breaking the province
will occur before resolving Display of Power's effect.
Should Pilgrimage (Core, 22) not be broken when Display
of Power resolves, the delayed effect of Display takes
precedence over Pilgrimage, canceling the normal
resolution of "Resolve Ring Effects" and replacing it with
the adjusted means of resolution. However, the Pilgrimage
effect ("cancel all ring effects") still cancels the Display of
Power's attempt to resolve the ring for the defender. The
defender claims the ring.
Because Display of Power interacts with the "Resolve Ring
Effects" step rather than the specific effect chosen by the
attacker, the attacker does not have the option to choose
a specific ring effect to resolve when Seeker of Knowledge
(Core, 171) is attacking (or whether they would like to
resolve a ring effect at all). When Display of Power resolves
the ring effect, the defender has the opportunity to choose
which ring effect they would like to resolve instead, and
may choose to not resolve the ring's effect if they desire.
Banzai! (204)
When Banzai! is played, a player can choose to cancel Banzai!'s
entire card effect, just the second part of its effect, or none of
its effect.
When Banzai!'s effect initiates during the step 6 of playing
the card (see page 11), the effects that initiate are: "you
may lose 1 honor, the chosen character gets +2 , and if
you lost 1 honor resolve this ability twice." If Banzai!'s
effects are canceled at this time, none of those things
happen and the card's effects do not resolve at all.
If those effects resolve, and the 1 honor is lost, "resolve this
ability twice" causes the ability's resolution to return to
step 5 ("choose a participating character"). This causes the
effects to initiate a second time, and thus they can be

38
canceled a second time to prevent the second +2 and
optional honor loss.
Disciples of the Void
Secluded Shrine (12)
The ring chosen for Secluded Shrine's effect can be in multiple
states at once. For example, while unclaimed, the chosen ring
simultaneously counts as being in both the unclaimed ring pool
and in your claimed ring pool.
You cannot move the chosen ring out of your claimed ring
pool due to the cost or effect of a card ability unless the
physical ring token is in your claimed ring pool.
Warriors of the Wind
Agasha Taiko (14)
The province that is chosen by Agasha Taiko's ability cannot be
declared as the attacked province and the conflict cannot be
moved to it.
If Agasha Taiko is played during a conflict and chooses the
currently attacked province for her ability, the conflict
immediately ends with no winner and all participating
characters are moved home bowed.
Masters of the Court
Maker of Keepsakes (7)
If a character "cannot receive dishonored status tokens," then
those tokens cannot be placed on or moved to that character.
That character cannot be dishonored if it is ordinary.
Seekers of Wisdom
Dragon Tattoo (23)
After you play an interrupt or reaction event that targets a
character with Dragon Tattoo attached, the tattoo can be used
to play that event again. The interrupt or reaction event is
played during the interrupt/reaction window that the card was
originally played in.
When an interrupt or reaction is played in this way, it is
"queued" into the appropriate interrupt/reaction window,
but is not actually played until the reaction window for
playing the original event closes. Therefore, cards like
Watch Commander (Core, 133) will trigger after the first
instance of the event but before the second instance of the
event—this is different from when Dragon Tattoo plays an
action event, as an Action event (such as Hurricane Punch
(Elemental Cycle, 17)) is fully played and resolved within
the resolution of Dragon Tattoo's ability.

Imperial Cycle
Test of Skill (93)
If you play Test of Skill from the top of your deck (with a card
such as Artisan Academy (Core, 53) or Pillow Book (Imperial,
93)), it will take up one of the "revealed card slots" in its cost,
but be ineligible to be put into your hand by its effect.
When an event card is played, it is considered to remain in
its original zone until its cost has successfully been payed,
at which point it gets placed onto the table in a state of
"being played" before being placed in its owner's discard
pile after its effects resolve. Therefore, during the payment
of the Test of Skill's cost, it is still on top of your deck and
will be revealed as part of the cost of playing the event.
While it is already revealed by the Academy or Pillow Book,
it can still be revealed again to satisfy its own cost.
However, once it leaves the top of your deck (after paying
costs and choosing targets in step 5—see ‘Initiating
Abilities' on page 11), it no longer becomes "one of the
revealed cards" and cannot be put back into your hand. For
more information, see ‘In Play and Out of Play' on page 10.
Waning Hostilities (100)
Waning Hostilities limits each player to one conflict
opportunity for the phase. Because Waning Hostilities sets a
hard limit, no amount of additional conflicts gained through
card effects can allow players to declare more than one conflict
in that phase.
Elemental Cycle
The Mirror's Gaze (15)
The Mirror's Gaze cannot be used to copy interrupts or
reactions whose effects cancel a card effect or framework step.
The following cards are some examples of some events that
cannot be copied by this attachment for this reason: Voice
of Honor (Core, 145), Display of Power (Core, 179), Forged
Edict (Core, 184), Censure (Imperial Cycle, 60)
The Mirror's Gaze cannot be used to copy events whose effects
reference their triggering conditions (which are ignored).
The following cards are some examples of some events that
cannot be copied by this attachment for this reason:
Indomitable Will (Core, 158), Ready for Battle (Core, 165),
I Can Swim (Core, 187), Way of the Chrysanthemum
(Imperial Cycle, 80)
Master Alchemist (44)
Master Alchemist can be used to place fate on the ring
while it is contested or claimed. Fate will stay on rings up until
the point at which they become contested. If the ring is already
being contested when fate is added to it, the attacker will not
gain that fate.
Children of the Empire
Kakita Toshimoko (14)
If a participating character's skill values are dependent upon
players' honor bids, Kakita Toshimoko's interrupt ability can

39
alter the calculation of skill totals in step 3.2.3 before fully
resolving that step by changing those players' bids and
potentially changing which player wins or loses the conflict due
to the change in skill values.
Because interrupts resolve before their triggering
condition (page 11), and because "would" effects have the
capability to change the triggering condition (page 20),
Toshimoko's ability has the potential to change the
outcome of step 3.2.3. Therefore, if: a character's skill
values are dependent upon the players' honor bids,
Toshimoko's duel changes those bids, and he loses the
duel, then it is possible that Toshimoko could lose the duel
but win the conflict (if up against a Sincere Challenger
(Children of the Empire, 27) who loses composure in a
political conflict, for example, or by being honored by
Kyūden Kakita (Masters of the Court, 1)). It is also possible
that recalculating skill values for step 3.2.3 due to
Toshimoko's ability could cause a province that would
originally be breaking to no longer be breaking if the loss of
skill (or increase of Toshimoko's skill) causes the attacking
player to not have the excess skill necessary to cause the
province to break.
Unmatched Expertise (65)
If a character "cannot receive dishonored status tokens," then
those tokens cannot be placed on or moved to that character.
That character cannot be dishonored if it is ordinary. (See page
32.)
Inheritance Cycle
Command Respect (18)
When an event card is played, it is considered to still be in its
owner's hand while determining whether a card's play
restrictions are met. Command Respect cannot be played if
both players have the same number of cards in hand.
Akodo Kaede (28)
Akodo Kaede's effect can prevent a character from being
sacrificed. (See Reprieve, page 29)
Steward of the Rich Frog (54)
When an event card is played, it is considered to still be in its
owner's hand until after all costs and selections have been
made.
While choosing targets during Step 5 of the process of
playing For Shame (Core, 207) on a Steward of the Rich
Frog, the Steward's text prevents characters from receiving
dishonored status tokens. Because selecting options
happens during the same step as choosing targets, the For
Shame is still in the opponent's hand when the selection is
made, and an option whose effect would fail to change the
game state cannot be selected.
If a character "cannot receive dishonored status tokens," then
those tokens cannot be placed on or moved to that character.
That character cannot be dishonored if it is ordinary.

Dominion Cycle
Seven Stings Keep (25)
When resolving this stronghold's ability, the process of
declaring a conflict is inverted. The conflict begins with the
declaration of defenders, which means the defending
characters will be participating in the conflict before the
attacking characters are declared (and before there is an
attacked province, a conflict type, or a contested ring). Because
there is no conflict type when defenders are declared, any
character may be declared as a defender. If the conflict type
chosen by the attacking player would result in an ineligible
defender—for example, because the defender has a dash skill
value for the declared conflict type—then that character
moves home bowed.
When declaring attackers, the attacking player must choose a
number of attacking characters equal to the number chosen
when paying the cost of Seven Stings Keep's ability. If a number
was chosen greater than the number of eligible attackers, the
attacking player must declare the greatest number of possible
attackers. This may force the attacking player to select a
particular ring or conflict type to make the declaration of the
required number of attackers eligible. For example, if a
character has a dash skill value and it must be declared to
reach the chosen number of attackers, then a conflict must
be declared.
Retire to the Brotherhood (28)
If a player reveals their entire deck and does not reveal a
number of characters equal to the number of characters they
discarded to this province's effect, they do not reshuffle their
discard pile to keep revealing more cards. They only put into
play the characters revealed, even though this results in fewer
characters entering play than the number of characters that
were discarded.
If a player reveals multiple copies of a unique character to this
province's effect, or reveals a unique character already in play
that they own or control, they do not put the duplicate(s) into
play. They do not reveal or put into play any additional
characters to make up for the unique characters that could not
enter play.
Silent Ones Monastery (50)
When a player would gain more than 2 honor per phase due to
honor being transferred between players, such as by an honor
bid, the Silent Ones Monastery prevents all but 2 of it. The
honor is not lost by the player giving honor because it is not
gained by the player who would be gaining honor.
Study the Natural World (68)
The effect of this event adds the element(s) of the attacked
province to the contested ring immediately and creates a
delayed effect that allows the attacking player to resolve each
of the contested ring's effects if they win the conflict. This
delayed effect occurs during step 3.2.3 of conflict resolution, at
which point the attacking player may either resolve all of the
contested ring's effects or none of them. It does not replace
framework step 3.2.6, when the attacking player may also
resolve [b]one[/b] of the contested ring's effects as normal.
Under Siege (89)
If the defending player has no cards in their hand, this card
cannot be played.as normal.

Foothills Keep (94)
When paying the additional cost for attacking a province other
than Foothills Keep, fate cannot be spent to the ring selected
to be the contested ring as the conflict is declared.
Contested Countryside (106)
All ability limits are player-specific, so this holding allows the
attacking player to trigger the attacked province's abilities,
even if the defending player also triggers those abilities.
Divine Ancestry (110)
If you cannot lose honor, you cannot give honor to an
opponent (and they cannot take honor from you). Any card
effect or framework step that would require the transfer of
honor is ignored.
Compromised Secrets (135)
If the attached character has a forced ability, that ability gains
the additional cost of giving the opponent 1 honor. Because the
ability is forced, it must be triggered and therefore the costs
(giving the opponent 1 honor) must be paid.
If Compromised Secrets and the character it is attached to are
both controlled by the same player, the additional cost to
trigger the character's abilities would require a player to give
themself 1 honor. Because a player cannot give themself 1
honor, the additional cost cannot be paid, and therefore the
abilities cannot be triggered.
Through The Mists
Lucky Coin (11)
During conflicts, Lucky Coin only disables the effects of
dishonored status tokens. The character is still dishonored.
However, it doesn't subtract its glory from its skills and its
controller doesn't lose honor when it leaves play (during a
conflict).
Pride (19) and Noble Vanguard(21)
The attachments created by Pride and Noble Vanguard have no
name, therefore the attachment limit does not apply. This
means that multiple of these attachments can be attached to
the same character.
Cherished Family Servant (36)
Cherished Family Servant enters play under the control of your
opponent. Therefore, the Dire ability on Cherished Family
Servant applies its effect to Poison attachments attached to
your opponent's characters as effects always apply to the
controller of a card, unless otherwise specified.
