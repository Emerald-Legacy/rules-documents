<p>Version 4.0 – March 8, 2023</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document is intended as the definitive source for rules information for the Emerald Legacy, the fan continuation of Fantasy Flight Games' Legend of the 5 Rings LCG.
The majority of this guide consists of the glossary, which provides an alphabetical listing of terms and situations a player might encounter during a game.
This section should be the first destination for players who have a rules question.
The latter part of this guide contains two appendices.
The first appendix provides detailed timing diagrams that illustrate the structure of an entire game round, as well as how to handle each game step presented in those diagrams.
The second provides a detailed anatomy of each card type.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ability">Ability</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An ability is the special game text that a card contributes to the game. Card abilities fall into one of the following types: actions, constant abilities, interrupts, keywords, and reactions. Some interrupt and reaction abilities are also forced.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Card abilities only interact with, and can only target, cards that are in play, unless the ability specifically refers to an out-of-play area or element. Card abilities on characters, attachments, holdings, strongholds, and provinces can only be initiated or affect the game while they are in play unless the ability specifically refers to being used from an out-of-play area, or require that the card be out of play for the ability to resolve. Event cards and role cards implicitly interact with the game from an out-of-play area, as established by the rules of their card types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application or initiation of the following types of abilities is mandatory: constant abilities, forced interrupt abilities, and forced reaction abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initiation of any keyword which uses the word "may" in its keyword description is optional. The application of all other keywords is mandatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initiation of action, interrupt, and reaction abilities is optional. The word "may" also incorporates a player option into the resolution of an ability. The player who controls the card on which an optional ability exists determines whether or not he or she wishes to use that ability at the appropriate time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ability prefaced by a bold-face timing trigger followed by a colon is referred to as a "triggered ability."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The controller of the card from which an ability is resolving makes all decisions required by that ability&#8217;s resolution unless another player is specified by the ability&#8217;s text.</p>

<p>An action ability is a triggered card ability that contains the boldface "Action:" precursor. An action ability may be triggered by its controller during any action window (see <a href="#_appendix_i_timing_and_gameplay">Appendix I: Timing and Gameplay</a>).</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_active_player">Active Player</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some phases, the game creates an active player, who is granted
permission to perform a specified task.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>During the dynasty phase, the active player is the player who is permitted to play character cards from his or her provinces or initiate an action ability. The status of active player alternates between players in this phase until all players have passed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the conflict phase, the active player is the player with the opportunity to initiate a conflict, or the player who is resolving a conflict he or she has initiated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_additional_conflicts">Additional Conflicts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some card abilities allow a player to declare an additional conflict during the conflict phase. The additional conflict created by such an effect is in addition to a player&#8217;s two normal conflict opportunities. It does not replace the normal <span class="emeralddbsm">&#59648;</span> or <span class="emeralddbsm">&#59649;</span> conflict opportunity that player has each conflict phase.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_additional_cost">Additional Cost</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some card abilities require an additional cost to be played to play a card, trigger an ability, or perform a framework step. If the additional cost cannot be paid, the game action cannot be initiated.</p>

<h3 id="_against">Against</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During a conflict, the attacking player and the defending player are considered to be taking part in the conflict against each other.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ancestral">Ancestral</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ancestral is a keyword ability that appears on attachments. If the card or game element to which an ancestral attachment is attached leaves play, the ancestral attachment is returned to its owner&#8217;s hand instead of being discarded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_attachment_cards">Attachment Cards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attachment cards represent weapons, armor, items, skills, spells, conditions, and titles. An attachment card enters play ready and attached to another card or game element, and remains in play unless it is removed by an ability, or unless the attached card leaves
play.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An attachment cannot enter play if there is no eligible card or game element to which it can attach. <strong>A card or game element becomes ineligible for a player&#8217;s attachment if a copy of that attachment controlled by the same player is already attached to it.</strong><br>
<strong>Example:</strong> <em>Otomo Courtier is the only character in play and has Karolina&#8217;s Ornate Fan attached to it. Karolina has another copy of Ornate Fan in hand, but she is not allowed to play it, as there are no eligible targets for it. She cannot choose to play Ornate Fan on the Otomo Courtier and discard the other copy. Karolina&#8217;s opponent Martin, however, can play his copy of Ornate Fan on the Otomo Courtier, as the two copies of Ornate Fan would be controlled by different players.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An attachment can only attach to a character in play, unless otherwise specified by the attachment&#8217;s text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no limit on the number of attachments that may be attached to a card or game element. <strong>However, only one copy of an attachment (by name) per player can be attached to a card or game element at the same time.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If a situation arises where a card or game element has multiple copies of an attachment controlled by the same player attached to it, its controller (or the First Player, if there is no controller) must immediately discard copies of that attachment until there is only one copy attached.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, simultaneously discard the attachment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a situation arises in which an attachment is not legally attached, discard the attachment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An attachment a player controls remains under his or her control even if the card or game element to which it is attached is under an opponent&#8217;s control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An attachment card bows and readies independently of the card to which it is attached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an attachment has skill modifiers, those modifiers apply to the skill of the attached character. Such modifiers apply to the character even while the attachment is bowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachments on a province are not considered to be in that province.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a character card is in play as an attachment, the skill values on that character-as-attachment are not treated as skill modifiers (as they lack the "+" or "-" symbol before the value) for the character to which the card is attached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an attachment has a limit (for example "Limit 1 <strong><em>Battlefield</em></strong> attachment per province"), that indicates that only one instance of a particular subset of cards can be attached to the same card or game element. If a second card of that subset becomes attached to the card or game element, the previously attached card is discarded as the limit has been surpassed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="_attacker_attacking_character_attacking_player">Attacker, Attacking Character, Attacking Player</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term "attacking character" refers to a character that is participating in a conflict on the side of the player who initiated the conflict. The term "attacker" is also used as shorthand for "attacking character."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term "attacking player" refers to the player that initiated the conflict that is currently resolving.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="_base_value">Base Value</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The value of a quantity before other modifiers are applied. For most quantities, it is also the printed value.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_bid_value">Bid Value</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the value of an honor bid is modified, resolve that bid as if the modified value is that player&#8217;s bid. The value of a bid may exceed five (the highest number on the honor dial), or may be reduced to zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the value of an honor bid is modified, the setting on the dial is not itself adjusted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a card ability references a player&#8217;s honor bid, the ability is referencing the current setting on the player&#8217;s honor dial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_blank">Blank</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an ability causes a card&#8217;s printed text box to be considered "blank", that text box is treated as if it did not have any of its printed <strong><em>Traits</em></strong> or card abilities. Text gained from another source is not blanked.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_breaking_a_province_broken_province">Breaking a Province, Broken Province</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the attacking player wins a conflict with a total skill difference (between the attacking player and the defending player) equal to or greater than the defense strength of the attacked province, the province breaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rotate a province card 180 degrees or discard a province token to indicate the province is broken.</p>
</li>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a triggered ability is preceded by the modifier "Conflict", that ability can only be triggered during a conflict. It functions as a shorthand for the following triggering conditions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On events, provinces, strongholds and holdings "Conflict X:" replaces "X: During a conflict, &#8230;&#8203;"</p>

<p>On characters "Conflict X:" replaces "X: During a conflict in which this character is participating, &#8230;&#8203;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On attachments "Conflict X:" replaces "X: During a conflict in which attached character is participating, &#8230;&#8203;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a Triggered Conflict Ability can only be triggered in a conflict of a specific type, the boldface timing command is preceded by the <span class="emeralddbsm">&#59648;</span> or <span class="emeralddbsm">&#59649;</span> symbols, respectively.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> <em>A character has the ability "<span class="emeralddbsm">&#59648;</span><strong>Conflict Action:</strong> Pay 1 fate - ready this character." This is equivalent to "<strong>Action:</strong> During a <span class="emeralddbsm">&#59648;</span> conflict in which this character is participating, pay 1 fate - ready this character."</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a card&#8217;s remaining triggering conditions directly contradict parts of this replacement, the card&#8217;s text takes precedence.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> <em>The attachment Stinger (Through the Mists 34) has the ability "<span class="emeralddbsm">&#59648;</span><strong>Conflict Action:</strong> While this card is in your hand, choose an attacking character and lose 1 honor - &#8230;&#8203;". Because Stinger has to be in your hand in order to trigger its ability, it does not have an attached character. In this case, the "<span class="emeralddbsm">&#59648;</span><strong>Conflict Action:</strong>" is interpreted as "<strong>Action:</strong> During a <span class="emeralddbsm">&#59648;</span> conflict, &#8230;&#8203;" instead of "<strong>Action:</strong> During a <span class="emeralddbsm">&#59648;</span> conflict in which attached character is participating, &#8230;&#8203;"</em></p>

<h3 id="_interrupts">Interrupts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An interrupt is a triggered ability whose text is prefaced by a boldface "<strong>Interrupt</strong>:" precursor. An interrupt ability interrupts the resolution of its triggering condition, sometimes canceling or changing the resolution of that condition. Always resolve interrupts to a triggering condition before resolving the consequences of the triggering condition itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike actions, which are resolved during action windows, an interrupt may be initiated only if its specified triggering condition occurs, as described in the interrupt ability&#8217;s text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a triggering condition initiates (but before it completes its resolution), an interrupt window for that triggering condition opens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the interrupt window, the first player always has the first opportunity to initiate an eligible interrupt (to the triggering condition that opened the window), or pass. Opportunities to initiate an eligible interrupt, or pass, continue to alternate between the players until all players consecutively pass, at which point the interrupt window closes. Passing does not prevent a player from initiating an eligible interrupt later in that same interrupt window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once an interrupt window closes, further interrupts to that specific triggering condition cannot be initiated. The triggering condition now completes its resolution (as long as its effects have not been canceled).</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise noted by the ability, each interrupt ability may be initiated once each round. (This includes forced interrupts.)</p>

<h3 id="_keywords">Keywords</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A keyword is a card ability which conveys specific rules to its card. The keywords in the game are: Ancestral, Composure, Courtesy, Covert, Disguised, Eminent, Legendary X, Limited, No Attachments, Pride, Rally, Restricted, Sincerity, and Support.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes a keyword is followed by reminder text, which is presented in italics. Reminder text is a shorthand explanation of how a keyword works, but it is not rules text and does not replace the rules for that keyword in this glossary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keywords that resolve based on the occurrence of a triggering condition (such as a character leaving play) resolve immediately after the triggering condition occurs, before triggering any reaction abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A card can have multiple instances of the same keyword. However, a card that does so functions as if it has one instance of that keyword, and the keyword will only resolve once per triggering condition. Variable keywords (see below) are an exception: if a card has multiple instances of a variable keyword, each of those instances acts on the card independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some keywords, such as Composure, are variable keywords. Variable keywords operate in the same way as other keywords, but their effects are unique on a card-by-card basis. Each variable keyword has the same condition in which they become active, but different effects based on the individual card&#8217;s text.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lasting_effects">Lasting Effects</h3>

<p>Some abilities create conditions that affect the game state for a specified duration. Such effects are known as lasting effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that created it, for the duration specified by the effect. The effect continues to affect the game state for the specified duration regardless of whether the card that created the lasting effect is or remains in play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a lasting effect affects in-play cards (or a specified set of cards), it is only applied to cards that are in play (or that meet the specifications of the set) at the time the lasting effect is established. Cards that enter play (or change status to meet the criteria of the specified set) after a lasting effect&#8217;s establishment are not affected by that lasting effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lasting effect expires as soon as the timing point specified by its duration is reached. This means that an "until the end of the phase" lasting effect expires before an "at the end of the phase" ability or delayed effect may initiate.</p>

<h3 id="_treaties">Treaties</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the course of an enlightenment format game, players may
find themselves in situations where a mutually beneficial
agreement called a treaty can be made. In addition to setting up
the terms of the treaty, both players agree on value to stake on the
treaty (by default, an amount of honor). If either player breaks
their part of a treaty, that player must suffer consequences based
on the value staked on the treaty.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When two players are setting up a treaty, each of the following
parameters must be specified. Those players may discuss and
determine these parameters in any order, but each parameter
must be agreed upon by both involved players before a treaty can
be finalized. The parameters are as follows:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>What is Being Promised by Each Player: When making a promise
for a treaty, a player offers something they are going to do, or not
do, during the course of the game. This promise must be an action
or a decision that a player can take and cannot include an exchange
of game components (honor, fate, cards, or claimed rings).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duration: When a treaty is established, both involved players must
agree to a duration for how long the treaty is going to last. This
duration can be of any length, from "immediate" to "the remainder
of the game." Once a treaty&#8217;s duration has ended it either is
dissolved (if both players have kept their promises), or it is broken
(if one player did not do what they promised in the specified
timeframe), causing the player that broke the treaty to suffer the
consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value: Both involved players must agree upon value to stake on the
treaty (between 1 and 5). If during the course of play, the treaty
between the two players is broken by either player, the player that
broke the treaty suffers a penalty based on the value staked on the
treaty. By default, this comes in the form of losing that amount of
honor, though it may be defined by a treaty card.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a treaty has been broken, the players are no longer bound
by the promises they made when establishing the treaty.
Each player can form a treaty with any number of other
players, but each pair of players may only have one treaty
active between them at any given time. If a treaty between two
players has dissolved, or been broken, a new treaty may be
formed between those players.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_treaty_cards">Treaty Cards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Treaty cards are included in the Clan War expansion and can be
used to increase variety when playing the enlightenment format.
To use these cards, shuffle them into a treaty deck at the start of
the game and set it within reach of all players. These replace the
default method of staking honor on treaties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever two players agree on a treaty, they place the top card of
the treaty deck facedown between them without looking at it and
mark the value staked on the treaty. When a player breaks that
treaty, they reveal the card and resolve its text. Note that any
treaty card that refers to "the player who did not break this treaty"
refers only to the single other player with whom the treaty was
made.</p>
</div>

effects unrevealed), put that treaty card on the bottom of the
treaty deck.</p>

<h3 id="_triggered_abilities">Triggered Abilities</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A boldface timing command followed by a colon indicates that an
ability is a triggered ability. Triggered abilities fall into one of the
following types: actions, interrupts, and reactions. Some interrupt
and reaction abilities are also forced.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unless the timing command is prefaced by the word "Forced,"
all triggered abilities are optional. They can be triggered (or
not) by their controller at the ability&#8217;s appropriate timing point.
Forced triggered abilities are triggered automatically by the
game at the ability&#8217;s appropriate timing point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any targets that must be chosen in the resolution of a
card&#8217;s "Forced" ability are chosen by the controller of that
card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise specified by the ability itself, each triggered
ability may be triggered once per round. This limit is player
specific.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Triggered abilities are written in a "triggering condition
(and/or) cost (and/or) targeting requirements - effect"
template. Ability text before the dash consists of triggering
conditions (and/or) costs (and/or) targeting requirements.
Ability text after the dash consists of effects. and may
sometimes include targeting requirements that come into play
as the effect is being resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a triggered ability has no dash, the ability has no pre-dash
content, and the entirety of the ability is considered an effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A triggered ability can only be initiated if its effect has the
potential to change the game state on its own. This potential is
assessed without taking into account the consequences of the
cost payment or the consequences of any other ability
interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A triggered ability can only be initiated if its cost (after
modifiers) has the potential to be paid in full.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>A triggering condition is a condition which dictates when an ability
can be triggered. On card abilities, the triggering condition is the
element of the ability that references such a condition, which most
often comes in the form of a specific occurrence that takes place
during the game. This indicates the timing point at which the ability
may be used. The description of an ability&#8217;s triggering condition
often follows the word "when" (for interrupt abilities) or the word
"after" (for reaction abilities), or the word "if" (for action abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a single occurrence creates multiple triggering conditions for
reactions or interrupts (such as a single Earth ring effect causing a
player to draw a card and another player to discard a card), those
triggering conditions are handled in shared interrupt/reaction
windows, in which abilities that refer to any of the triggering
conditions created by that occurrence may be used in any order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following is a sequence of possible interrupt and reaction
opportunities that exists around each triggering condition that may
arise in a game:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The triggering condition becomes imminent. (Meaning that if it
is not canceled, changed, or otherwise preempted by interrupt
abilities, the triggering condition is the next thing that will
occur in the game.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interrupt abilities that reference when the imminent triggering
condition "would" occur may be used. (Note: For effects, a
"cancel" interrupt may prevent the effect from initiating, and
the initiation of the effect is a separate triggering condition
that precedes the effect&#8217;s resolution. "Cancel" interrupts are
the only type that will reference the initiation of an effect.) If
the imminent triggering condition is canceled, none of the
subsequent steps in this sequence occur. If the triggering
condition is changed, the original condition is no longer
imminent, but the new triggering condition is now imminent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forced interrupts that reference the imminent triggering
condition must resolve, in the order determined by the first
player. The standard interrupt window to the imminent
triggering condition opens. It closes after all players
consecutively pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The triggering condition itself occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forced reactions that reference the triggering condition must
resolve, in the order determined by the first player.</p>

<p>The reaction window to the triggering condition opens. It
closes after all players consecutively pass.</p>

<p>If a duel is initiated during a conflict, both characters chosen must be participating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a duel is initiated by an ability on a character card, that character is automatically involved in the duel. Some abilities use the phrase "this character initiates" as a reminder of this. That character is not considered to be chosen as a target of the duel, as it is already involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During a conflict, a duel can only be initiated by an ability on a character card if that character is participating in the conflict.</p>
</li>

<h4 id="_resolve_the_duel">Resolve the duel</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A duel is resolved during the successful resolution of any triggered ability that instructs players to "resolve the duel," or that their "character challenges the opponent&#8217;s character to a [type] duel." A duel resolution is split into 3 steps taken in sequence. The steps are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> during this step the rules of the duel are defined</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus:</strong> each player involved in the duel selects and reveals their honor bid for the duel, then the result of the duel is determined</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strike:</strong> the consequences of the duel are applied</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are no action windows during a duel, so players are not able to initiate actions or play characters and attachments from their hands during the resolution of a duel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During a duel each player can trigger special abilities that affect the duel itself. Those abilities are marked as <strong>Duel Challenge</strong>, <strong>Duel Focus</strong>, and <strong>Duel Strike</strong>. Each player can trigger a single effect for each phase. For example, you could trigger both a <strong>Duel Focus</strong> and a <strong>Duel Strike</strong>, but you cannot trigger two <strong>Duel Focus</strong> abilities, regardless of their names. Whenever those abilities refer to characters they refer to the characters involved in the duel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Players can also trigger applicable interrupt and/or reaction abilities during a duel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All abilities triggered during a Duel follow the normal order of priority, with the First Player having the first opportunity to trigger an ability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_d_2_challenge">D.2 Challenge</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process of initiating the duel (in step D.1) will have identified:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the two characters that are involved in the duel. Those characters are the contestants in this duel. The side that initiated the duel is the challenger, the other side is the challenged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the kind of duel that will take place. This statistic (MIL skill, POL skill, or glory) will be used to determine the results of the duel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this, <strong>Duel Challenge</strong> abilities can be triggered. Those abilities can replace the contestants or the statistic of the duel, among other effects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_d_3_focus">D.3 Focus</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player secretly selects a number from 1 to 5 on their honor dial as their honor bid for this duel. Once both players have confirmed that they are ready, proceed to the next step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The players simultaneously reveal their bids. Once a player reveals an honor bid, the dial is placed next to the player&#8217;s stronghold or conflict deck and remains as a reference point until the next honor bid occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After revealing their bids <strong>Duel Focus</strong> abilities can be triggered. Those abilities can modify the bids or dials, or they can modify the calculations that define the duel results, among other effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player with the higher honor bid must give an amount of honor to the player with the lower honor bid that is equal to the difference between the two bids. If the bids are equal, no honor is transferred.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Challenge step of the duel (D.2) the statistic of the duel was defined. Check their printed value for that statistic. If multiple characters are involved in the duel on the same side, add their dueling statistics together. Those characters win or lose the duel together</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player calculates their duel total by adding their statistic to their honor bid plus any other modifier that apply specifically to this duel. Then compare the total with that of their opponent to determine the duel results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The character whose controller has the higher duel total is the duel&#8217;s winner.
The character whose controller has the lower duel total is the duel&#8217;s loser.
If the duel totals are the same, neither character is the duel&#8217;s winner and neither character is the duel&#8217;s loser.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_d_4_strike">D.4 Strike</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ability that initiated the duel (in step D.1) specified the consequences of this duel for the winning and/or losing characters, or for the player(s) controlling those characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before applying the duel consequences, <strong>Duel Strike</strong> abilities can be triggered. Then, apply the duel consequences.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_d_5_duel_ends">D.5 Duel ends</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This step formalizes the end of the duel. Return to the action window in which the duel was initiated, with the next player in the sequence of actions having the next opportunity to act.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: There are no action windows during a duel, so players are not able to initiate actions
or play characters and attachments from their hands during the resolution of a duel.
Applicable interrupt and/or reaction abilities may be triggered  during a duel.</p>

<p>If a participating character&#8217;s skill values are dependent upon

resolving that step by changing those players' bids and
potentially changing which player wins or loses the conflict due
to the change in skill values.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because interrupts resolve before their triggering
condition (page 11), and because "would" effects have the
capability to change the triggering condition (page 20),
Toshimoko&#8217;s ability has the potential to change the
outcome of step 3.2.3. Therefore, if: a character&#8217;s skill
values are dependent upon the players' honor bids,
Toshimoko&#8217;s duel changes those bids, and he loses the
duel, then it is possible that Toshimoko could lose the duel
but win the conflict (if up against a Sincere Challenger
(Children of the Empire, 27) who loses composure in a
political conflict, for example, or by being honored by
Kyūden Kakita (Masters of the Court, 1)). It is also possible
that recalculating skill values for step 3.2.3 due to
Toshimoko&#8217;s ability could cause a province that would
originally be breaking to no longer be breaking if the loss of
skill (or increase of Toshimoko&#8217;s skill) causes the attacking

<ul>
<li>
<p>When resolving this stronghold&#8217;s ability, the process of
declaring a conflict is inverted. The conflict begins with the
declaration of defenders, which means the defending
characters will be participating in the conflict before the
attacking characters are declared (and before there is an
attacked province, a conflict type, or a contested ring). Because
there is no conflict type when defenders are declared, any
character may be declared as a defender. If the conflict type
chosen by the attacking player would result in an ineligible
defender—for example, because the defender has a dash skill
value for the declared conflict type—then that character
moves home bowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When declaring attackers, the attacking player must choose a
number of attacking characters equal to the number chosen
when paying the cost of Seven Stings Keep&#8217;s ability. If a number
was chosen greater than the number of eligible attackers, the
attacking player must declare the greatest number of possible
attackers. This may force the attacking player to select a
particular ring or conflict type to make the declaration of the
required number of attackers eligible. For example, if a
character has a dash <span class="emeralddbsm">&#59648;</span> skill value, and it must be declared to
reach the chosen number of attackers, then a <span class="emeralddbsm">&#59649;</span> conflict must
